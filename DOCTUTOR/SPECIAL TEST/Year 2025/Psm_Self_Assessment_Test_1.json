UNICEF is assisting in the implementation of the Applied Nutrition Programme in the form of implements, seeds, manure and water supply equipment, along with FAO. Wherever land is available, the facilities provided by the UNICEF should be utilized in developing school gardens. The produce may be utilized in the school feeding programmes as well as for nutrition education. The ANP was first implemented in Orissa and Andhra Pradesh in 1962. By 1973, the whole country was covered by the scheme. This programme till date is the best conceived nutrition programme. The programme was initiated as a centrally sponsored scheme but now is implemented by the states.</p><p>Objectives:</p><ul><li>To make people conscious of their nutritional needs,</li><li>To increase production of nutritious foods and its consumption and</li><li>To provide supplementary nutrition to vulnerable groups through local production of food.</li><li>The programme aimed at the approach of \"self reliance\" to be developed at the community and individual level.</li></ul><p>Beneficiaries:</p><ul><li>Children between 3-6 years</li><li>Pregnant and lactating mothers.</li></ul><p>Activities: ANP envisaged production of nutritious bod by people themselves and to be consumed by them to improve their own nutritional status. Poultry farming, horticulture, beehive keeping, kitchen gardening and nutrition education were main activities in the programme. The supplementary nutrition was provided to children and women beneficiaries.</p><p>Organisation: The programme is implemented under the supervision of block development officer. The Balsevikas with the help of a helper undertake the programme activities at the village/community level.</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong></p><p><a title=\"https://www.nin.res.in/academics/notifications/Prospectus%20MSc%20(AN)%20&amp;%20(SN)%20-%202021-23.pdf,\" href=\"https://www.nin.res.in/academics/notifications/Prospectus%20MSc%20(AN)%20&amp;%20(SN)%20-%202021-23.pdf,\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nin.res.in/academics/notifications/Prospectus%20MSc%20(AN)%20&amp;%20(SN)%20-%202021-23.pdf,</a></p>",

It is also essential for the normal functioning of the skin, intestinal and nervous systems. This vitamin differs from the other vitamins of the B-complex group in that an essential amino acid, tryptophan serves as its precursor.</p><p>Sources</p><p>Foods rich in niacin and/or tryptophan are liver, kidney meat, poultry, fish, legumes and groundnut. Milk is a poor source of niacin but its proteins are rich in tryptophan which is converted in the body into niacin(about 60mg of tryptophan is required to result in 1mg of niacin). The vitamin is resistant to heating.</p><p>Deficiency</p><ul><li>Niacin deficiency results in pellagra. Pellagra is common in maize/jowar eating populations. Limiting amino acid in maize is Tryptophan. Amino-acid imbalance caused by an excess of leucine is the cause of pellagra in both jowar and maize eaters. Excess of leucine appears to interfere in the conversion of tryptophan to niacin. In maize, niacin occurs in \"bound\" form unavailable to the consumer</li><li>The disease is characterized by three D's -diarrhoea, dermatitis and dementia. In addition glossitis and stomatitis usually occur.</li><li>The dermatitis is bilaterally symmetrical and is found only on those surfaces of the body exposed to sunlight, such as back of the hands, lower legs, face and neck. The cutaneous lesions consist of a pigmented rash aggravated by sunlight esp. neck when it is known as 'Casal's Necklace'. More acute cases may progress to vesiculation, ulceration and secondary infection. Classically, the erythema progresses to roughening and keratosis with scaling.</li><li>Gauntlet sign of pellagra: Severe photo dermatitis leading to hyperpigmentation and thickening of skin on back of the hands.<br> Mental changes may also occur which include depression, irritability and delirium. In most chronic forms, posterolateral cord degeneration and peripheral nerve lesions are seen. Prevention</li><li>Pellagra is a preventable disease. A good mixed diet containing milk and/or meat is universally regarded as an essential part of prevention and treatment. Avoidance of total dependence on maize or sorghum is an important preventive measure. Pellagra is a disease of poverty. Given modern knowledge and opportunities for economic, agricultural and social development, there is every reason to hope that this disease could be eliminated</li><li>Nixtamalization: Maize/corn is treated with lime(alkali), niacin will become bioavailable.</li></ul><p>Maize diet is poor in tryptophan which is required for Niacin production in the body. Hence, Maize diet consumption is associated with Pellagra.</p>",

It is a zoonotic disease, i.e., infecting mainly animals and incidentally man. The envelope glycoprotein of the JE virus contains specific as well as cross-reactive, neutralizing epitopes. Japanese B encephalitis is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia, including India</p><p><strong>EPIDEMIOLOGICAL FEATURES</strong></p><p><strong>CYCLES OF TRANSMISSION</strong></p><ol><li>Pig-Mosquito-Pig</li><li>The Ardeid bird-Mosquito-Ardeid bird</li></ol><p>Transmission occurs principally in rural agricultural location where flooding irrigation is practised. Transmission is seasonal and mainly related to the rainy season in South-East Asia Region. JE transmission intensifies during the rainy season, when vector population increases.</p><p><strong>HOSTS</strong></p><ul><li>The disease is transmitted to man by the bite of infected mosquitoes. Man is an incidental 'dead-end' host. Man to man transmission has not so far been recorded.</li><li>Animal hosts: Among the animal hosts, pigs have been incriminated as the major vertebrate hosts for JE virus. Infected pigs do not manifest any overt symptoms of illness but circulate the virus so that mosquitoes get infected and can transmit the virus to man. The pigs are thus considered as 'amplifiers' of the virus Cattle and buffaloes may also be infected with the JE virus; although they may not be natural hosts of JE virus, they act as 'mosquito attractants'. Horses are the only domestic animals so far known which show signs of encephalitis due to JE virus infection.</li><li><strong>Birds hosts:</strong> Some species of birds such as pond herons; cattle egrets and perhaps poultry and ducks appear to be involved in the natural history of JE virus.</li></ul><p><strong>MOSQUITO VECTORS</strong></p><p>Culicine mosquitoes, notably C. tritaeniorhynchus, C. vishnui and C. gelidus along with some anophelines have been incriminated as the vectors of JE. Among these, C.tritaeniorhynchus and vishnui has been implicated as the most important vector in South India. C. tritaeniorhynchus is the major vector worldwide including India. C. vishnui is the next common vector found in India. These mosquitoes generally breed in irrigated rice fields, shallow ditches and pools. The rice fields are probably the most important breeding places. These mosquitoes are zoophilic, feeding primarily on vertebrate hosts.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>c. High incidence of intestinal parasitosis:</strong>This is the correct answer. Intestinal parasitosis, such as infections with parasites like Giardia lamblia or Ascaris lumbricoides, can lead to nutrient malabsorption and increased nutrient losses through diarrhoea, resulting in micronutrient deficiencies. However, intestinal parasitosis is not directly linked to zinc deficiency. Instead, it can contribute to deficiencies in other nutrients like iron and vitamin A.</p><p><strong>Why the other options are not correct:</strong></p><p>Zinc deficiency is indeed common in children from developing countries due to various factors.</p><p><strong>a. Less consumption of animal food: </strong>Animal foods, such as meat, poultry, and seafood, are rich sources of zinc. In developing countries, where access to animal foods may be limited due to factors like economic constraints or cultural dietary practices, children may not consume enough zinc-rich foods, leading to a deficiency.</p><p><strong>b. High dietary phytate content:</strong>Phytates are compounds found in plant foods like grains, legumes, and nuts. Phytates can bind to zinc and inhibit its absorption in the intestine. In diets high in phytate-rich foods, the bioavailability of zinc is reduced, increasing the risk of zinc deficiency, particularly in populations reliant on plant-based diets.</p><p><strong>d. Frequent diarrheal episodes</strong>: Frequent diarrheal episodes can lead to increased zinc losses through stool, exacerbating zinc deficiency. Diarrhoea not only results in the loss of zinc but also impairs zinc absorption due to intestinal damage and inflammation. Therefore, children experiencing frequent diarrheal episodes are at higher risk of zinc deficiency.</p><p>In summary, options a, b, and d are all factors that contribute to zinc deficiency in children from developing countries, while option c (high incidence of intestinal parasitosis) is less directly associated with zinc deficiency and is more closely linked to other nutrient deficiencies resulting from malabsorption and increased nutrient losses.</p>",

When chlorine is added to water, it undergoes various chemical reactions that produce disinfecting agents, primarily hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and hypochlorite ions (OCl<sup>-</sup>). However, the disinfecting action of chlorine on water is mainly attributed to hypochlorous acid.</p><p><strong>Why the other options are not suitable:</strong></p><p><strong>A. Hydrogen chloride:</strong>Hydrogen chloride (HCl) is a gas that dissolves in water to form hydrochloric acid (HCl) rather than contributing directly to the disinfecting action of chlorine. Hydrochloric acid itself is not a disinfectant commonly used in water treatment processes.</p><p><strong>C. Hypochlorite ions: </strong>Hypochlorite ions (OCl<sup>-</sup>) are formed when chlorine reacts with water, and they do contribute to the disinfecting action of chlorine. However, hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is considered to be a more effective disinfectant than hypochlorite ions. Hypochlorous acid is a stronger oxidizing agent and is more effective at penetrating microbial cell walls to disrupt cellular processes and kill microorganisms.</p><p><strong>D.

It is expressed as a percentage and is used to evaluate the adequacy of natural lighting in indoor environments, particularly in architectural design and building planning.</p><p><strong>a. 8%:</strong>This option suggests that the daylight factor in a living room should be 8%. This value represents a moderate amount of natural daylight penetration, which is typically considered sufficient for providing comfortable illumination and reducing the need for artificial lighting during daylight hours. An 8% daylight factor ensures that the living room receives adequate natural light without excessive glare or heat gain.</p><p><strong>Why the other options are not suitable:</strong></p><p><strong>b. 6%:</strong>While a 6% daylight factor may still provide some natural light in a living room, it is lower than the recommended value of 8%. In spaces with a 6% daylight factor, occupants may experience dimmer lighting conditions and may rely more heavily on artificial lighting to supplement illumination, especially in areas further away from windows or daylight openings.</p><p><strong>c. 10%:</strong>A daylight factor of 10% represents a higher level of natural daylight penetration than the recommended value of 8%. While greater daylight penetration can be beneficial for enhancing visual comfort and reducing energy consumption for lighting, a 10% daylight factor may also increase the risk of glare and heat gain in some situations, particularly if not properly managed through shading or window treatments.</p><p><strong>d. 15%:</strong>A daylight factor of 15% is significantly higher than the recommended value of 8% for a living room. While greater daylight penetration can offer advantages such as improved mood, productivity, and energy efficiency, excessively high daylight levels may lead to issues such as glare, discomfort, and potential damage to furnishings or artwork from UV exposure. Therefore, a 15% daylight factor may be more appropriate for spaces with specific daylighting requirements, such as offices, classrooms, or art galleries, rather than residential living rooms.</p><p>In summary, option a (8%) is the correct choice for the daylight factor in a living room, as it provides a balanced level of natural daylight penetration for comfortable and energy-efficient indoor lighting.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>d. Pyrethrum:</strong>Pyrethrum is a natural insecticide derived from the flowers of certain species of chrysanthemum. While pyrethrum is highly effective against adult mosquitoes and other insects, it is not typically used to target mosquito larvae. Pyrethrum primarily acts as a contact insecticide, affecting insects upon direct contact with the substance. It is less effective in water environments where mosquito larvae reside. Therefore, pyrethrum is not considered an anti-larval method but rather an adulticidal or insecticidal method.</p><p><strong>Why the other options are not suitable:</strong></p><p><strong>a. Intermittent irrigation:</strong>Intermittent irrigation involves alternating periods of flooding and drying in agricultural fields to disrupt the breeding sites of mosquitoes. This method is effective in controlling mosquito larvae because it disrupts their habitat and prevents them from completing their life cycle. Therefore, intermittent irrigation is considered an anti-larval method.</p><p><strong>b. Paris green</strong>: Paris green is a toxic substance containing copper (II) acetate and arsenic (III) acetate. It has been historically used as an insecticide, including for controlling mosquito larvae. Paris green works by poisoning the larvae when they come into contact with the treated water. Therefore, Paris green is also an effective anti-larval method.</p><p><strong>c. Gambusia affinis:</strong>Gambusia affinis, commonly known as the western mosquitofish, is a species of fish that feeds on mosquito larvae. Introducing Gambusia affinis into water bodies containing mosquito larvae can significantly reduce mosquito populations as the fish consume the larvae. Therefore, Gambusia affinis is considered an anti-larval method.</p><p>In summary, option D is the correct answer because pyrethrum is not an anti-larval method, unlike the other options which are all effective in controlling mosquito larvae.</p>",

Typhoid vaccine:</strong>Typhoid fever is a bacterial infection transmitted through contaminated food and water. Following an earthquake, there may be disruptions to water and sanitation systems, increasing the risk of waterborne diseases like typhoid. In some situations, the WHO may recommend vaccination against typhoid to prevent outbreaks among displaced populations living in crowded conditions with limited access to clean water and proper sanitation.</p><p><strong>b. Cholera vaccine</strong>: Cholera is another waterborne disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Like typhoid fever, cholera outbreaks can occur in the aftermath of natural disasters, especially when sanitation infrastructure is compromised and access to safe drinking water is limited. In such situations, vaccination campaigns targeting at-risk populations may be considered as part of comprehensive cholera control efforts.</p><p><strong>c. Tetanus vaccine</strong>: Tetanus is a bacterial infection caused by Clostridium tetani, which can enter the body through wounds or cuts contaminated with soil, dust, or feces containing the bacterium. In the immediate aftermath of earthquakes or other disasters, injuries and wounds are common due to collapsing buildings, falling debris, and other hazards. Ensuring access to tetanus vaccination and wound care is essential to prevent tetanus infections among those injured during the disaster.</p><p>While all of these vaccines may be important in certain disaster response scenarios, the specific recommendation depends on the context and assessment of the health risks by public health authorities and organizations like the WHO.
