The cyclins are a family of proteins whose concentration increases and decreases at specific times, that is, \"cycle\" during the cell cycle - thus their name. The cyclins thus activate, at the appropriate time, different cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) that phosphorylate substrates essential for progression through the cell cycle.</p><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/Quiz2025/NEETPG/QuizFeb2025/LiveQuizII16022025/26E.jpg\"><p>For example, cyclin D levels rise in late <em>G1</em> phase and allow progression beyond the start (yeast) or restriction point (mammals), the point beyond which cells irrevocably proceed into the S or DNA synthesis phase.</p><p>The D cyclins activate CDK4 and CDK6. These two kinases are also synthesized during <em>G1</em> in cells undergoing active division. The D cyclins and CDK4 and CDK6 are nuclear proteins that assemble as a complex in late <em>G1</em> phase. The cyclin-CDK complex is now an active serine - threonine protein kinase. One substrate for this kinase is the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein. Rb is a cell-cycle regulator because it binds to and inactivates a transcription factor (E2F) necessary for the transcription of certain genes (histone genes, DNA replication proteins, etc) needed for progression from <em>G</em>1 to S phase. The phosphorylation of Rb by CDK4 or CDK6 results in the release of E2F from Rb-mediated transcription repression - thus, gene transcription activation ensues and cell-cycle progression takes place.</p><p>Cyclin E and CDK2 form a complex in late <em>G1</em>. Cyclin E is rapidly degraded, and the released CDK2 then forms a complex with cyclin A. This sequence is necessary for the initiation of DNA synthesis in S phase. A complex between cyclin B and CDK1 is rate-limiting for the <em>G2</em>/M transition in eukaryotic cells.</p><p>Many of the cancer-causing viruses (oncoviruses) and cancer-inducing genes (oncogenes) are capable of alleviating or disrupting the restriction that normally controls the entry of mammalian cells from <em>G1</em> into the S phase. From the foregoing, one might have surmised that excessive production of a cyclin, loss of a specific CDK inhibitor, or production or activation of a cyclin/CDK at an inappropriate time might result in abnormal or unrestrained cell division. Similarly, the oncoproteins (or transforming proteins) produced by several DNA viruses target the Rb transcription repressor for inactivation, inducing cell division inappropriately, while inactivation of Rb, itself a tumor suppressor gene, leads to uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation.</p><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/Quiz2025/NEETPG/QuizFeb2025/LiveQuizII16022025/26E1.jpg\"><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Harper's illustrated biochemistry 32<sup>nd</sup> edition CH 35 PN 369</p>",

In the center actively proliferating fibroblast with numerous mitotic figures, cytological atypia and loose random arrangement is found. In the periphery more organized arrangement of mature fibroblast with transformation into mature osteoid is seen. This is in contrast to neoplastic lesion in which more mature cells are seen at the center</p><p>More about Myositis Ossificans (Aka Hematoma Ossificans)</p><p>It is a benign pathological bone formation (heterotopic ossification) in muscles and other soft tissues <strong>Trauma is </strong>t<strong>he most common inciting event</strong>, but may occur without trauma in paraplegics, Guillain-Barre (GB) syndrome, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) encephalopathy, closed head injury, following extensive burns and in a comatose patient. One-third cases are idiopathic.</p><p>Most commonly affected muscles are <strong>quadriceps, glutei and brachialis.</strong> However, the elbow joint is most commonly involved joint by myositis ossificans. After injury, massage to the elbow and vigorous passive physiotherapy may provoke the development of myositis ossificans.</p><p>Pathology: It is a <strong>calcium hydroxyapatite</strong> deposition in soft tissues being composed of a benign matrix rich in fibroblasts and osteoclast like giant cells.</p><p>Clinical features: Clinical features are divided into three phases:</p><p><strong>Acute phase:</strong> After a few days to a few weeks of injury, patient develops pain swelling and stiffness of nearby joints.</p><p><strong>Pseudotumoral phase</strong>: This comes after 2-3 weeks and characterized by painless hard mass.</p><p><strong>Resolving phase:</strong> This comes after 3-6 months. Gradual resolution of the lesion may occur in this phase.</p><p>Radiology: Initial X-rays are normal. Calcification and mineralization are seen 2-3 weeks after the onset of symptoms and matures in next 3-6 months. Periosteal reaction is seen as laminations. There are three variants of the myositic mass. In stalked variant a peduncle is attached to the underlying bone. In sessile variant, the mass has a broad-based attachment to underlying periosteum. In a third variant bony mass is only attached to involved muscle.</p><p>Diagnosis: It can be made on clinical background in association with X-ray features. In doubtful cases diagnosis can be confirmed by biopsy. Biopsy also differentiates it from a bone-forming tumor like osteosarcoma due to the presence of zonal phenomena.</p><p>Treatment: In acute cases, treatment consists of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), ice, compression dressing, splintage for the involved limb and active range of motion physiotherapy. Passive stretching should be avoided, rather active exercises are to be encouraged. If required, excision of the ossified mass can be done after maturation, which usually takes a year or so (indicated by decreased levels of alkaline phosphatase and mature bone deposition on X-ray).</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Maheshwari Ortho 5th edition, page number 52</p>",
