This method uses electrodes to activate A&alpha; and A&beta; fibers in the vicinity of the injury.

The activity of these cutaneous mechanosensitive afferents reduce the responsiveness of dorsal horn neurons to their input from nociceptive afferent terminals. This is called the gate-control mechanism of pain modulation.</p>",
