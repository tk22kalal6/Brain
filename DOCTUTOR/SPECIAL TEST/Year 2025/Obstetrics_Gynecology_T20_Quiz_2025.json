Dysgerminomas are the most common malignant germ cell tumors and often show normal AFP, &beta;-hCG, and CA-125, but elevated ALP. In contrast, endodermal sinus tumors raise AFP, and malignant teratomas typically show elevated AFP or other markers. Mucinous cystadenocarcinomas are epithelial tumors and not associated with raised ALP. Hence, the correct answer is (a) Dysgerminoma.</p>",
