Galton also provided the first workable fingerprint classification system, which was later adapted by E. R.</p><p>EDWARD HENRY - Sir Edward Richard Henry, 1st Baronet, GCVO, KCB, CSI, KPM was the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis from 1903 to 1918. His commission saw the introduction of police dogs to the force, but he is best remembered today for his championship of the method of fingerprinting to identify criminals.</p><p>EDMUND LOCARD - Dr. Edmond Locard was a French criminologist, the pioneer in forensic science who became known as the \"Sherlock Holmes of France\". He formulated the basic principle of forensic science: \"Every contact leaves a trace\". This became known as Locard's exchange principle.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>The doctrine of Res ipsa loquitur, meaning \"the thing speaks for itself,\" is applied in cases where negligence is inferred from the very nature of the incident, without needing direct evidence. In medical practice, this doctrine comes into play when the harm caused is of such a nature that it would not ordinarily occur without negligence, and the injury is under the control of the medical professional.</p><p>In the case of a hysterectomy surgery resulting in ureter damage, the injury is not a typical or expected outcome of the procedure under proper care. If the surgeon damages the ureter, the burden of proof shifts to the medical professional to demonstrate that the harm was not due to negligence. Since this injury falls outside the normal risks of surgery and often indicates a lapse in technique, it is covered under the doctrine of Res ipsa loquitur.</p><p>The patient does not need to provide direct evidence of negligence. Instead, the fact that such an injury occurred under the exclusive control of the surgeon raises a presumption of negligence unless the surgeon can provide an adequate Explanation.</p><p><strong>Rule Out:</strong></p><p><strong>(a) Medical maloccurrence:</strong></p><p>This term refers to adverse outcomes that are not preventable despite following appropriate standards of care. Ureter damage during hysterectomy is not typically classified as a \"maloccurrence,\" as it usually suggests a preventable error rather than an unavoidable complication.</p><p><strong>(b) Novus actus interveniens:</strong></p><p>This legal doctrine refers to an \"intervening act\" that breaks the chain of causation between an initial act and the harm caused. It is not applicable here, as the injury occurred directly during surgery and was under the control of the surgeon.</p><p><strong>(c) Therapeutic misadventure:</strong></p><p>This term is used for unintended but recognized complications or adverse outcomes that occur despite proper care and skill during medical treatment. While this could apply to certain adverse events, ureter damage during hysterectomy is often seen as an avoidable error, making Res ipsa loquitur more appropriate in legal terms.</p><p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p><p>The doctrine of Res ipsa loquitur applies when an injury occurs in circumstances where negligence is the most likely Explanation, especially in medical settings.</p><p>Ureter damage during a hysterectomy is generally considered preventable and raises a presumption of negligence, invoking the Res ipsa loquitur principle.</p><p>The burden of proof shifts to the surgeon to prove that the injury was not caused by negligence.</p><p>Other doctrines like Therapeutic misadventure or Medical maloccurrence address unavoidable complications or recognized risks, which do not fit this scenario.</p>",
