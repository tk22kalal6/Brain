Narrowing the size of the nasal airway helps to relieve the symptoms. Among the techniques followed, some are:<ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-roman;\"><li>Submucosal injection of teflon paste.</li><li>Insertion of fat, cartilage, bone or teflon strips under the mucoperiosteum of the floor and lateral wall of nose and the mucoperichondrium of the septum.</li><li>Section and medial displacement of lateral wall of nose.</li></ol></li></ul><p>Other options:</p><ul><li>Rhinoscleroma: Both streptomycin (1 g/day) and tetracycline (2 g/day) are given together for a minimum period of 4-6 weeks and repeated, if necessary, after 1 month. Treatment is stopped only when two consecutive cultures from the biopsy material are negative. Steroids can be combined to reduce fibrosis. Surgical treatment may be required to establish the airway and correct nasal deformity.</li><li>Vasomotor rhinitis: Treatment is mainly medical with avoidance of physical factors; antihistaminics and oral nasal decongestants and topical steroids. Surgical management is done to relieve nasal obstruction by reducing the size of nasal turbinates. Excessive rhinorrhoea, not corrected by medical therapy and bothersome to the patient, can be relieved by sectioning the parasympathetic secretomotor fibres to nose (vidian neurectomy).</li></ul><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Diseases of Ear, Nose and Throat &amp; Head and Neck Surgery, PL Dhingra 7<sup>th</sup> edition; Page 173, 175, 191</p>",

First, one of the tonsillar crypts, usually the crypta magna, gets infected and sealed off. It forms an intratonsillar abscess which then bursts through the tonsillar capsule to set up peritonsillitis and then an abscess.</li><li>Culture of pus from the abscess may reveal pure growth of Streptococcus pyogenes, S. aureus or anaerobic organisms. More often the growth is mixed, with both aerobic and anaerobic organisms.</li><li>It mostly affects adults and rarely the children though acute tonsillitis is more common in children.</li><li>Clinical features: include high grade fever (upto 104&deg;F), severe pain in throat, odynophagia (so marked that the patient cannot even swallow his own saliva which dribbles from the angle of his mouth). Patient is usually dehydrated.</li><li>Patient has a muffled and thick speech, often called \"hot potato voice\" and foul breath due to sepsis in the oral cavity and poor hygiene.</li><li>Ipsilateral earache (referred pain via CN IX) and trismus (due to spasm of pterygoid muscles which are in close proximity to the superior constrictor)</li><li>Examination (as shown in the image) reveals: the tonsil, pillars and soft palate on the involved side are congested and swollen.</li><li>Tonsil itself may not appear enlarged as it gets buried in the oedematous pillar.</li><li>Uvula is swollen and oedematous and pushed to the opposite side.</li><li>Bulging of the soft palate and anterior pillar above the tonsil.</li><li>Mucopus may be seen covering the tonsillar region.</li><li>Cervical lymphadenopathy (jugulodigastric lymph nodes) is commonly seen.</li><li>Torticollis - Patient keeps the neck tilted to the side of abscess.</li><li>Treatment includes: Hospitalization, IVFs (to combat dehydration), antibiotics and analgesics.</li><li>If a frank abscess has formed, incision and drainage will be required. It is opened at the point of maximum bulge above the upper pole of tonsil or just lateral to the point of junction of anterior pillar with a line drawn through the base of uvula. With the help of a guarded knife, a small stab incision is made and then a sinus forceps inserted to open the abscess.</li><li>Surgical management include Interval tonsillectomy where tonsils are removed 4-6 weeks following an attack of quinsy.</li></ul><p>Other options:</p><ul><li>Parapharyngeal abscess: Anterior compartment involvement will present with prolapse of tonsil and tonsillar fossa, trismus (due to spasm of medial pterygoid muscle) and external swelling behind the angle of jaw. Posterior compartment involvement produces bulge of pharynx behind the posterior pillar, paralysis of CN IX, X, XI, and XII and sympathetic chain, and swelling of parotid region.</li><li>Retropharyngeal abscess: usually causes bulge in the posterior pharyngeal wall with symptoms of dysphagia and torticollis.</li><li>Ludwig's angina: presents with trismus. When infection is localized to the sublingual space, structures in the floor of mouth are swollen and tongue seems to be pushed up and back. When infection spreads to submaxillary space, submental and submandibular regions become swollen and tender, and impart woody-hard feel. Usually, there is cellulitis of the tissues rather than frank abscess. Tongue is progressively pushed upwards and backwards threatening the airway. Laryngeal oedema may appear.</li></ul><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Diseases of Ear, Nose and Throat &amp; Head and Neck Surgery, PL Dhingra 7<sup>th</sup> edition; Page 298-99, 303.</p>",

It will cause vertigo and nystagmus. Wait till vertigo and nystagmus subside.</li><li><strong>Position 2.</strong> Head is now turned so that affected ear is facing up at a 90&deg; rotation.</li><li><strong>Position 3</strong>. The whole body and head are now rotated away from the affected ear to a lateral recumbent position in a 90&deg;-rotation face-down position.</li><li><strong>Position 4</strong>. Patient is now brought to a sitting position with head still turned to the unaffected side by 45&deg;.</li><li><strong>Position 5.</strong> The head is now turned forward and chin brought down 20&deg;.</li><li>There should be a pause at each position till there is no nystagmus or there is slowing of nystagmus, before changing to the next position.

On repetition of the test, nystagmus may still be elicited but lasts for a shorter period. On subsequent repetitions it disappears altogether, i.e. nystagmus is fatiguable.
