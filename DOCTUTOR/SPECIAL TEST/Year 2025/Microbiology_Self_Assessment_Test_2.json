The bacilli spread through the lungs producing hemorrhagic pneumonia. Cyanosis is very prominent. The bloody mucoid sputum that is coughed out contains bacilli in enormous numbers. Pneumonic plague is highly infectious and in untreated patients, almost invariably fatal.</p><p>Option (A): Bubonic Plague - In <strong>bubonic plague,</strong>after an incubation period of 2-5 days, the lymph nodes draining the site of entry of the bacillus become infected. In some, the infection remains localised at the site of the flea bite, with only minor constitutional symptoms (pestis minor). As the plague bacillus usually enters through flea bites on the legs, the inguinal nodes are involved and hence the name ' bubonic'.</p><p>Option (C): Septicaemic Plague - <strong>Septicaemic plague </strong>is usually the terminal event in the bubonic or pneumonic plague but may sometimes occur primarily. Meningitic involvement may occur rarely. Human carriers have not been recorded but asymptomatic oropharyngeal infection has been observed in some contacts.</p>",
