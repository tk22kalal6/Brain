This gives broad spectrum prophylaxis against bacterial colonisation and is particularly effective against <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </em>and also methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>.</li><li><strong>Silver nitrate solution (0.5%)</strong>. Again, this is highly effective as a prophylaxis against <em>Pseudomonas </em>colonisation, but it is not as active as silver sulphadiazine cream against some of the gram-negative aerobes. The other disadvantage of this solution is that it needs to be changed or the wounds resoaked every 2-4 hours. It also produces black staining of all the furniture surrounding the patient.</li><li><strong>Mafenide acetate cream</strong>. This is popular, especially in the United States, but is painful to apply. It is usually used as a 5% topical solution, but has been associated with metabolic acidosis.</li><li><strong>Silver sulphadiazine and cerium nitrate</strong>. This is also a very useful burn dressing, especially for full-thickness burns. It induces a sterile eschar on the burned skin and has been shown in certain instances, especially in elderly patients, to reduce some of the cell-mediated immunosuppression that occurs in burns. Cerium nitrate forms a sterile eschar and is especially useful in treating burns when a conservative treatment option has been chosen. Cerium nitrate has also been shown to boost cell-mediated immunity in these patients.</li></ul><p><strong>Reference</strong>: Bailey &amp; Love's short practice of surgery, chapter: 46, Edition: 28<sup>th</sup>, Pg: 674</p>",
