The patient has to merely state what according to him was the act of negligence.</p><p><strong>Conditions to be satisfied:</strong></p><ol><li>That in the absence of negligence the injury would not have occurred ordinarily.</li><li>That the doctor had exclusive control over the injury producing instrument or treatment.</li><li>That the patient was not guilty of contributory negligence.</li></ol><p>This enables the patient's lawyer to prove his case without medical evidence.</p><p><strong>Examples:</strong></p><ol><li>Prescribing an overdose of medicine producing ill-effects.</li><li>Giving poisonous medicine carelessly.</li><li>Failure to give anti-tetanic serum in cases of injury causing tetanus.</li><li>Burns from application of hot water bottles or from X-ray therapy.</li><li>Breaking of needles.</li><li>Failure to remove the swabs/instruments during operation which may lead to complications or cause death.</li><li>Blood transfusion misadventure.</li><li>Loss of use of hand due to prolonged splinting.</li></ol><p><strong>Application:</strong>&nbsp;This doctrine is applied both to civil and criminal negligence.

This principle applies to cases of&nbsp;assault and accidental injury when continuity of events is broken by an entirely new and unexpected happening, due to negligence of some other person.

The onset of swelling starts within fifteen minutes and there is often blood-stained discharge from the wound. Persistent bleeding from bite site is a constant feature. Blisters begin to appear in about 12 hours in and around the bite site, progressing subsequently to involve the entire limb.</li><li>Haematuria may be seen within a few hours of the bite. Prominent features are shock and haemorrhage.</li><li>In about 10 to 15% of the cases, extensive necrosis of skin, subcutaneous tissues and muscles may occur followed by epistaxis, haemoptysis, ecchymoses, intracranial and subconjunctival haemorrhages, and bleeding into the floor of the mouth, tympanic membrane, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract, retroperitoneum and intraperitoneum. In severe cases, the main feature is the persisting shock.</li><li>Bleeding and clotting time are usually prolonged. A haemorrhagic syndrome with blood-stained sputum, haemorrhages from the gums, rectum, the site of bite, etc., occur due to the increased coagulation time. Intravascular haemolysis may lead to haemoglobinuria.</li><li>In the case of Russell's viper and hump-nosed viper, renal failure is a frequent complication. Petechial haemorrhages are common. Death is usually due haemorrhage.</li></ul><p>FEATURES OF COBRA BITE</p><ul><li>Local symptoms start within 6 to 8 minutes. A small reddish wheal develops at the site of bite. The bitten area is tender with slight radiating burning pain and oozing of bloodstained fluid. Swelling may be minimal or even absent.</li><li>The patient feels sleepy, slightly intoxicated, weakness of legs and is reluctant to stand or move. Ptosis is the earliest neuroparalytic manifestation followed by ophthalmoplegia. There may be extraocular muscle weakness and strabismus.</li><li>Weakness of the muscles increases and develops into paralysis of the lower limbs. The paralysis then spreads to the trunk and affects the head which falls forward. The eyelids also hang down. After half to one hour, there is excessive salivation and even vomiting, headache, vertigo, paraesthesia around the mouth and myalgia. This is followed by paralysis of the facial muscles, palate, jaws, tongue, vocal cords, neck muscles. Muscles of deglutition become progressively flaccidly paralysed due to which there is difficulty in speech and swallowing. After about two hours, the paralysis is complete.</li><li>Respiratory arrest may occur due to obstruction of upper airway by the paralysed tongue or inhaled vomitus or due to paralysis of intercostal muscles and diaphragm. Coma sets in and finally the respirations stop with or without convulsions and the heart stops.</li></ul><p>FEATURES OF KRAIT BITE</p><ul><li>Symptoms resemble those of cobra bite, but there is no swelling or burning pain at the site of the bite and the convulsions are milder, while the feeling of drowsiness and intoxication is more intense. Albumin appears in urine.</li></ul><p>FEATURES OF SCORPION STING</p><ul><li>This venom contains neurotoxins that cause sodium channels to remain open. Such envenomation usually are associated with little swelling, but prominent pain, paraesthesia and hyperesthesia can be accentuated by tapping on the affected area (the tap test).</li><li>These symptoms soon spread to other locations; dysfunction of cranial nerves and hyperexcitability of skeletal muscles develop within hours. Patients present with restlessness, blurred vision, abnormal eye movements, profuse salivation, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, slurred speech, difficulty in handling secretions, diaphoresis, nausea, and vomiting. Muscle twitching, jerking and shaking may be mistaken for a seizure.</li><li>Complications include tachycardia, arrhythmias, hypertension, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, and acidosis. Fatal respiratory arrest is most common among young children and the elderly.</li></ul><p>FEATURES OF WASP BITE</p><ul><li>Wasp venom is composed of biogenic amines like histamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, enzymes like Phospholipase A and B, hyaluronidase, toxic peptides etc.</li><li>Clinical Features: Local- Pain, redness, swelling</li><li>Systemic: Person allergic to venom may develop anaphylaxis - Tingling sensation, flushing, dizziness, syncope, vomiting and diarrhoea, wheezing, urticaria, angioedema, renal failure, haemolysis with haemoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis etc.</li></ul><p><strong>Reference:</strong> The Essentials of Forensic Medicine &amp; Toxicology, KS Narayan Reddy, 35th edition, Page No. 427</p>",

Consent signifies acceptance by a person of the consequences of an act that is being carried out. To be legally valid, it must be given after understanding what it is given for and of risks involved.</p><p>TYPES OF CONSENT</p><ol><li>INFORMED CONSENT: Informed consent implies an understanding by the patient of</li><ol><li>The nature of his condition,</li><li>The nature of the proposed treatment or procedure,</li><li>Expectations of the recommended treatment and the likelihood of success,</li><li>The details of the alternative courses of treatment that are available,</li><li>The risks and benefits involved in both the proposed and alternative procedure,</li><li>The potential risks of not receiving treatment, and the relative chances of success or failure of both procedures,</li><li>Particular known inherent risks that are material to the informed decision, so that he may accept or reject the procedure.</li><ul><li>All disclosures must be in language the patient can understand. Physicians have a legal, moral and ethical duty to provide all relevant information that enables a patient to either accept or reject treatment. This disclosure will very much reduce litigation, when the results are unsatisfactory or unexpected. The patient must show that the doctor did not adhere to accepted medical standards to prove liability for lack of informed consent.</li><li>Exceptions to informed consent:</li><ol><li>Emergency.</li><li>Therapeutic privilege.</li><li>When a patient waives his right to informed consent and delegates the right to the doctor or a close relative.</li></ol><li><strong>Informed Refusal:</strong> The physician has a duty to disclose adequately and appropriately to the patient, the risks or possible consequences of refusal to undergo a test or treatment. After understanding all the facts, the patient can refuse to submit to treatment or an operation. Examination may reveal findings which when used in the process of investigation can damage the party examined. If later on the party is proved to be innocent, the damage sustained cannot be undone. This is why the right to deny consent to examination is generally given to the party.</li><li><strong>Paternalism</strong> is an abuse of medical knowledge so as to distort the doctor-patient relationship in such a way that the patient is deprived of his autonomy or of his ability to make a rational choice. The doctor does not disclose the nature of the iIIness and the proposed treatment depriving the right of patient to accept or reject treatment.</li></ul></ol><li><strong>Implied Consent:</strong> An adult patient of sound mind who</li><ol><li>Knows that he can either agree or refuse to submit to treatment or an operation,</li><li>Knows or has been fully or fairly informed by his doctor as to what is to be done and</li><li>Then cooperated with the physician, has impliedly consented in words. The fact that a patient attends the hospital or calls the doctor to his house complaining of illness, implies that he consents to a general physical examination, to determine the nature of the illness. Consent is implied when a patient holds out his arm for an injection. Such implied consent is the consent usually given in routine practice.</li></ol><li><strong>Expressed Consent:</strong> Anything other than implied consent is expressed consent. In other words, an expressed consent is one, which is stated, in distinct and explicit language. The expressed consent may be of following types:</li><ol><li>Oral(verbal) consen- It is consent, which is given verbally. This method is employed for minor procedures. However, such consent should be obtained in the presence of a disinterested third party for example nurse or receptionist - Oral consent, when properly witnessed is of equal validity that of written consent.</li><li>Written Consent - Here the consent is obtained in a written format. The doctor should explain the type of therapeutic procedure or surgical operation properly to the patient. Written consent afford documentary evidence - When such consent is obtained after explaining the nature and consequences of the treatment procedure being contemplated is called as informed consent</li></ol><li><strong>Substituted consent:</strong> If a person in need of treatment is incapable of giving informed consent, consent(proxy consent) must be obtained from next of kin. The order of succession is generally spouse, adult child, parent and sibling.</li><li>Blanket(open) consent: The consent taken at the time of admission and practiced in most hospitals that cover almost everything a doctor might do to a patient without mentioning anything specific. It is of questionable legal validity.</li><li>Presumed consent assumes that an individual agrees in principle to the said procedure; if not, he/she must withdraw his/her consent, i.e., 'opt out'.</li></ol><p><strong>Reference:</strong> The Essentials of Forensic Medicine &amp; Toxicology, K S Narayan Reddy, 35<sup>th</sup> edition, Page No. 36</p>",
