The lesions may be segmental(affecting only a portion of the glomerulus) or global(involving the entire glomerulus). Affected glomeruli may exhibit swelling and proliferation of endothelial and mesangial cells associated with leukocyte accumulation, capillary necrosis and hyaline thrombi. Often, there also is extracapillary proliferation associated with focal necrosis and crescent formation. The clinical presentation ranges from mild hematuria and proteinuria to acute renal insufficiency. Red blood cell casts in the urine are common when the disease is active. Some patients progress to diffuse glomerulonephritis. The active(or proliferative) inflammatory lesions can heal completely or lead to chronic global or segmental glomerular scarring.</li><li>Diffuse lupus nephritis(class IV) is the most common and severe form of lupus nephritis. The lesions are identical to those in class III, but differ in extent; in diffuse lupus nephritis, half or more of the glomeruli are affected. Involved glomeruli show proliferation of endothelial, mesangial and epithelial cells, with the latter producing cellular crescents that fill Bowman's space. Subendothelial immune complex deposits may create a circumferential thickening of the capillary wall, forming \"wire-loop\" structures on light microscopy. Immune complexes can be readily detected by electron microscopy and immunofluorescence. Lesions may progress to scarring of glomeruli. Patients with diffuse glomerulonephritis are usually symptomatic, showing hematuria as well as proteinuria. Hypertension and mild to severe renal insufficiency also are common.</li><li>Membranous lupus nephritis(class V) is characterized by diffuse thickening of the capillary walls due to deposition of subepithelial immune complexes, similar to idiopathic membranous nephropathy. The immune complexes are usually accompanied by increased production of basement membrane-like material, resulting in \"holes\" and \"spikes\" on silver stain. This lesion is usually accompanied by severe proteinuria or nephrotic syndrome and may occur concurrently with focal or diffuse lupus nephritis.</li><li>Advanced sclerosing lupus nephritis(class VI) is characterized by sclerosis of more than 90% of the glomeruli and represents end-stage renal disease.</li></ul><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Robbins Basic Pathology, 10<sup>th</sup> ed, Pg: 154.</p>",

The heart may be enlarged and firm, but more often it shows no appreciable change on gross inspection. Histologically the deposits begin as focal subendocardial accumulations and within the myocardium between the muscle fibers. Expansion of these myocardial deposits eventually causes pressure atrophy of myocardial fibers. When the amyloid deposits are subendocardial, the conduction system may be damaged, accounting for the electrocardiographic abnormalities noted in some patients.</p><p>The diagnosis of amyloidosis is based on histopathology. With the light microscope and hematoxylin and eosin stains, amyloid appears as an amorphous, eosinophilic, hyaline, extracellular substance. The most widely used is the Congo red stain, which under ordinary light gives a pink or red color to tissue deposits, but far more striking and specific is the green birefringence of the stained amyloid when observed by polarizing microscopy. This staining reaction is shared by all forms of amyloid and is imparted by the crossed &beta;-pleated sheet configuration of amyloid fibrils. Confirmation can be obtained by electron microscopy, which reveals 7-10nm infinite long thin fibrils. Subtyping of amyloid is most reliably done by mass spectroscopy, as immunohistochemical stains are not entirely sensitive or specific.</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Robbins Basic Pathology, 10<sup>th</sup> ed, Pg: 186.</p>",
