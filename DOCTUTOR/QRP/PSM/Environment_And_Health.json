      "solution": "<ul>\n<li><strong>E. coli</strong> is the most reliable indicator of <strong>recent fecal contamination</strong> in water. Key points include:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Source:</strong> E. coli is part of the normal gut flora in humans and warm-blooded animals, making it a specific marker for fecal matter.</li>\n<li><strong>Indicator of Recent Contamination:</strong> Unlike other bacteria, E. coli does not survive long in the environment, indicating that water pollution has occurred recently, typically within the last few days.</li>\n<li><strong>Standard Testing Method:</strong> E. coli testing is a standard procedure in water quality assessments, often performed using membrane filtration or multiple-tube fermentation techniques.</li>\n<li><strong>Health Implications:</strong> The presence of E. coli suggests the potential for pathogens that can cause gastrointestinal illnesses, such as diarrhea, cramps, and nausea.</li>\n<li><strong>Regulatory Guidelines:</strong> Water safety regulations in many countries set specific limits for E. coli in drinking water, emphasizing its role in public health monitoring.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Common indicators of fecal contamination in water:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3d535v34tlady.cloudfront.net/V3/NEETPGMCQ/202412207b21a094-48b9-446c-8d4c-432d4eb3eb66.jpg\">\n<p><strong>Why Not Other Options:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A. Streptococci:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reason:</strong> Enterococci can indicate fecal pollution but are not as specific to human feces as E. coli. They can also be found in soil and vegetation, which reduces their reliability as indicators of recent fecal contamination.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>B. Klebsiella:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reason:</strong> While Klebsiella can be present in fecal matter, it is also found in a variety of environmental sources, such as soil and water. This makes it less specific for detecting recent fecal pollution compared to E. coli.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>C. Clostridium perfringens:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reason:</strong> This bacterium can indicate fecal contamination but is capable of surviving in the environment for longer periods, making it less effective for identifying recent pollution. Its presence may suggest older or historical contamination rather than recent fecal sources.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The presence of <strong>E. coli</strong> is the definitive evidence for <strong>recent fecal pollution</strong> in water, guiding public health measures and ensuring safe water supplies.

      "solution": "<ul>\n<li><strong>Trickling Filter</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>A trickling filter is a type of biological treatment system used for secondary sewage treatment.</li>\n<li>It consists of a bed of coarse materials (such as rocks, gravel, or synthetic media) that provides a surface for microorganisms to attach and grow.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Process</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Wastewater Distribution</strong>: Sewage is evenly distributed over the surface of the filter media.</li>\n<li><strong>Microbial Action</strong>: As the wastewater trickles down, microorganisms degrade the organic matter and pollutants present in the sewage.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduction in BOD</strong>: This biological process significantly reduces the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of the wastewater.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Efficiency</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>The trickling filter effectively treats sewage after primary treatment (which typically removes solids) by further reducing organic matter and improving overall water quality.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why Not Other Options:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>(a) Primary treatment of sewage</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>Primary treatment focuses on the physical removal of solids from sewage, typically through sedimentation. Trickling filters, relying on biological processes, are not designed for this initial step.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>(c) Sewage effluent treatment</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>While trickling filters can treat effluent, the term \"effluent treatment\" generally refers to the final treatment stages, which may include advanced methods not represented by trickling filters alone.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>(d) Sewage farming treatment</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>Sewage farming involves using treated sewage for irrigation. Trickling filters treat sewage but are not directly used for farming; instead, they prepare sewage for further treatment before it can be safely applied to crops.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong> Trickling filters are crucial in <strong>secondary sewage treatment</strong>, utilizing a biological process to break down organic pollutants through microbial action on a filter medium.
