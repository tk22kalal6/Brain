Ordinal scale:</strong> While ordered, the unequal intervals prevent the meaningful calculation of mean and standard deviation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Mean and standard deviation are only applicable to data on a ratio scale, allowing meaningful arithmetic operations.</li>\r\n<li>Ratio scales provide equal intervals and a true zero point, which are essential for calculating these statistical measures.</li>\r\n<li>Understanding the type of data scale is crucial for determining the appropriate statistical analyses to perform.</li>\r\n<li>Using inappropriate scales for these calculations can lead to misleading conclusions and ineffective data interpretation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3d535v34tlady.cloudfront.net/V3/NEETPGMCQ/2024122017251185-ff4a-4694-8473-0e64b535d666.jpg\">",
