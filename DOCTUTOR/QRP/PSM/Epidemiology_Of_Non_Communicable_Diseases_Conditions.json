      "solution": "<ul>\r\n<li><strong>High in potassium</strong> (D) is <strong>not</strong> a risk factor for hypertension. Potassium helps <strong>lower blood pressure</strong> by promoting <strong>sodium excretion</strong> and balancing the fluid levels in the body. It also helps relax the blood vessels, thereby reducing the pressure on the arterial walls. Good sources include <strong>bananas</strong>, <strong>oranges</strong>, <strong>spinach</strong>, <strong>potatoes</strong>, and <strong>beans</strong>.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Rich in sodium salts</strong> (A) is a <strong>major risk factor</strong> for hypertension. High sodium levels cause <strong>fluid retention</strong>, increasing <strong>blood volume</strong> and the force exerted on blood vessels, leading to higher blood pressure. Common sources of excessive sodium include <strong>processed foods</strong>, <strong>salty snacks</strong>, and <strong>canned goods</strong>.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Rich in saturated fats</strong> (B) can lead to the buildup of <strong>plaque</strong> in the arteries, narrowing blood vessels and raising blood pressure. Saturated fats also contribute to <strong>obesity</strong> and <strong>high cholesterol</strong> levels, both of which exacerbate hypertension. Saturated fats contribute to <strong>vascular stiffness</strong>, which increases <strong>resistance</strong> in blood vessels and raises blood pressure over time These fats are found in <strong>red meat</strong>, <strong>full-fat dairy products</strong>, and <strong>processed foods</strong>.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Rich in glucose</strong> (C), particularly <strong>refined sugars</strong>, can lead to <strong>weight gain</strong>, <strong>insulin resistance</strong>, and increased <strong>inflammation</strong>, all of which are linked to higher blood pressure.
