      "solution": "<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Scabies</strong> was identified in <strong>1687</strong> by <strong>Giovanni Cosimo Bonomo</strong> and <strong>Diacinto Cestoni</strong> as being caused by a <strong>microscopic mite, Sarcoptes scabiei</strong>, marking it as the <strong>first disease with an established microbial cause</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>This discovery was critical in advancing early <strong>parasitology</strong> and <strong>infectious disease understanding</strong>, as it was among the first to establish that <strong>microscopic organisms</strong> could cause <strong>visible disease symptoms</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>Bonomo's findings contributed to <strong>early epidemiology</strong>, emphasizing the importance of <strong>microscopic pathogens</strong> and shaping the <strong>early concepts of germ theory</strong>, later developed by scientists like <strong>Pasteur</strong> and <strong>Koch</strong>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Why Not Others:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>A. Malaria:</strong> The <strong>Plasmodium parasite</strong> was only identified in 1880 by <strong>Alphonse Laveran</strong>.</li>\r\n<li><strong>B. Smallpox:</strong> Caused by the <strong>variola virus</strong>, its viral nature was not understood until much later with advances in virology.</li>\r\n<li><strong>C. Dracunculiasis:</strong> <strong>Dracunculus medinensis</strong> was recognized as the cause of dracunculiasis, but this was not identified in 1687.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway: </strong>Scabies is notable as the <strong>first documented case of a disease caused by a microscopic organism</strong>, setting the foundation for <strong>modern microbiology</strong> and understanding of <strong>parasitic and infectious diseases</strong>.</p>",
