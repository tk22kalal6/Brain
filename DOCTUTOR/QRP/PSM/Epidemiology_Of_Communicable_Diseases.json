When symptoms occur they typically include fever, weakness, headaches, vomiting, and muscle pains. Less commonly there may be bleeding from the mouth or gastrointestinal tract. The risk of death once infected is about one percent and frequently occurs within two weeks of the onset of symptoms. Of those who survive, about a quarter have hearing loss, which improves within three months in about half of these cases.</p>\r\n<p>The disease is usually initially spread to people via contact with the urine or feces of an infected multimammate mouse. Spread can then occur via direct contact between people. Diagnosis based on symptoms is difficult. Confirmation is by laboratory testing to detect the virus's RNA, antibodies for the virus, or the virus itself in cell culture.

      "solution": "<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Caused by Chlamydia trachomatis but other pathogens often contribute</strong>: Correct. Chlamydia trachomatisis the primary causative agent, but other environmental bacteria can exacerbate the infection.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Blinding trachoma is characterized by entropion, trichiasis, and corneal ulcer</strong>: Correct. <strong>Blinding trachoma </strong>leads to severe scarring, <strong>entropion</strong>(inward eyelid turning), <strong>trichiasis</strong> (inward-growing eyelashes), and <strong>corneal ulcers</strong>, which can result in blindness.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Nonblinding trachoma never becomes blinding trachoma</strong>: Incorrect. Nonblinding trachoma can progress to <strong>blinding trachoma </strong>if <strong>untreated</strong>. Early-stage trachoma may not cause blindness, but repeated infections and scarring can cause severe complications over time.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Blinding trachoma requires urgent action</strong>: Correct. Immediate intervention is essential to prevent <strong>permanent blindness</strong>. Treatment typically involves <strong>antibiotics</strong>, surgery for eyelid deformities, and <strong>improving hygiene </strong>to prevent further infections..</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Trachoma </strong>is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, and its progression can lead to severe complications like <strong>blindness.</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Nonblinding </strong>forms can <strong>progress</strong> to <strong>blinding trachoma</strong> if untreated, making early intervention critical.</li>\r\n</ul>",
