Their activation is crucial for reflex actions, maintaining posture &nbsp;and coordinating movement.</li>\n<li><strong>Feedback Mechanism:</strong> This reflex action not only helps in maintaining balance but also serves as a protective mechanism to prevent overstretching of muscles.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why Not Other Options:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>B (Activation of gamma motor neurons):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Incorrect because while gamma motor neurons adjust intrafusal fiber tension within the muscle spindle, they do not directly participate in eliciting the knee jerk reflex.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>C (Inhibition of alpha motor neurons):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Incorrect since the inhibition of alpha motor neurons would lead to muscle relaxation rather than the contraction observed in the knee jerk reflex.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>D (Cortical involvement):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Incorrect as the knee jerk reflex operates independently of cortical involvement, relying solely on spinal cord pathways for its execution.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>knee jerk reflex</strong> is a <strong>monosynaptic reflex arc</strong>, where activation of muscle spindle afferent fibers leads to <strong>immediate muscle contraction</strong>.</li>\n<li>This reflex exemplifies <strong>spinal cord reflex activity</strong>, showcasing how the body responds swiftly to stimuli without necessitating higher brain function.</li>\n<li><strong>Monosynaptic reflexes<br /></strong>Involve a single synapse, with one sensory neuron and one motor neuron. An example of a monosynaptic reflex is the knee jerk, or patellar stretch reflex, biceps and triceps jerk.</li>\n<li><strong>Polysynaptic reflexes<br /></strong>Involve at least two synapses and one interneuron. Most reflexes are polysynaptic, and can be inhibited by conscious control. An example of a polysynaptic reflex is the automatic withdrawal of the leg when it steps on a sharp object.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Polysynaptic reflexes are slower than monosynaptic reflexes because the majority of polysynaptic fibers are smaller in diameter, and some are not myelinated. This means that they conduct more slowly, and there is a delay every time a synapse is formed.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Loss of inhibition from the brainstem:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Correct Mechanism:</strong> The observed <strong>decerebrate rigidity</strong> results from unopposed activity of the extensor muscles due to the <strong>loss of inhibitory control</strong> from the brainstem following severe brain injury.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why not the other options?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A) Damage to the corticospinal tract:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Explanation:</strong> While damage to the corticospinal tract can cause abnormal posturing, <strong>decerebrate rigidity</strong> is specifically linked to <strong>brainstem inhibition loss</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>B) Disruption of the basal ganglia:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Explanation:</strong> Although basal ganglia disruption is associated with various movement disorders, it is not the primary cause of <strong>decerebrate rigidity</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>D) Dysfunction of the cerebellum:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Explanation:</strong> Cerebellar dysfunction mainly affects coordination and balance but does not primarily lead to <strong>decerebrate rigidity</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Decerebrate rigidity</strong> arises from a <strong>loss of inhibitory control</strong> from the brainstem, leading to unopposed extensor muscle activity.</li>\n<li>Recognizing the mechanisms behind abnormal posturing is crucial for understanding the extent and nature of brain injuries.</li>\n</ul>\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3d535v34tlady.cloudfront.net/V3/NEETPGMCQ/20241216e3d0f4e0-14e2-4a0a-a039-1a7288d6bb88.jpg\">",
