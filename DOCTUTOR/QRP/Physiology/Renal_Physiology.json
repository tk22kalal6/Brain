It works to relax vascular smooth muscle, causing <strong>dilation of blood vessels</strong>, including the afferent arterioles of the glomerulus decreases renal vascular resistance and increases GFR.</p>\r\n<p>Option B: Prostaglandins also cause <strong>vasodilation of the afferent arteriole</strong>, leading to an increase in renal blood flow thus, decrease renal vascular resistance and increase GFR.</p>\r\n<p>Option C: In pregnancy, the blood volume increases so, GFR is also increased.</p>\r\n<p>Option D: Endothelin is a Vasoconstrictor, which constricts the renal artery and reduces the blood flow, decreasing the GFR.

Renal Glycosuria is failure of the kidneys to reabsorb glucose. In renal glycosuria, the blood glucose concentration may be normal, but the transport mechanism for tubular reabsorption of glucose is greatly limited or absent. Consequently, despite a normal blood glucose level, large amounts of glucose pass into the urine each day.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option A: SGLT-1:</strong> This transporter primarily functions in the intestine, not in renal glucose reabsorption.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option C: GLUT-1:</strong> This is a facilitative glucose transporter responsible for glucose transport into cells but is not directly involved in renal reabsorption.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option D: GLUT-4:</strong> This insulin-dependent transporter is primarily found in adipose tissue and muscle, playing a role in glucose uptake but not in the kidney's glucose reabsorption.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>\r\n<p>In isolated renal glycosuria, mutations affect SGLT-2, responsible for glucose reabsorption in the kidneys, while SGLT-1, GLUT-1, and GLUT-4 are involved in other tissues or functions.</p>",
