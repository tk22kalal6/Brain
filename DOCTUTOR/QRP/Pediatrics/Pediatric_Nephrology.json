Inherited forms are secondary to a genetic abnormality, such as galactosemia, Wilson disease and cystinosis.</li>\r\n<li>Acquired forms are usually secondary to drugs and substances (e.g., <strong>gentamicin, valproic acid, cisplatin, 6-mercaptopurines, lead, mercury, uranium, platinum, and toluene</strong>) through acute tubular necrosis, alteration of renal blood flow, intratubular obstruction and allergic reactions.</li>\r\n<li>It is a generalized defect in the proximal tubule leading to:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Polyuria:</strong> Increased urination.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Polydipsia:</strong> Increased thirst due to loss of water.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Glycosuria:</strong> Presence of glucose in the urine despite normal blood glucose levels.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Aminoaciduria:</strong> Excess amino acids in the urine.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Phosphaturia:</strong> Increased phosphate excretion, which can lead to bone issues.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Metabolic Acidosis:</strong> Due to bicarbonate loss.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Hence, the syndrome is characterized by <strong>low molecular weight proteinuria, glycosuria, phosphaturia, aminoaciduria and proximal renal tubular acidosis.</strong></li>\r\n<li>Patients may present with growth failure early in the first year of life, with symptoms secondary to phosphate wasting, such as rickets.</li>\r\n<li>Specific laboratory abnormalities include glucosuria, normal blood sugar, high urine pH, mild to moderate serum hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, mild albuminuria, and normal serum protein and albumin.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>KEY TAKEAWAYS:</strong> Fanconi syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by a dysfunction in the renal tubules of the kidneys, leading to a variety of metabolic abnormalities. It primarily affects the <strong>proximal renal tubules, resulting in the impaired reabsorption of substances</strong> that should normally be reabsorbed from the urine back into the bloodstream.</p>",
