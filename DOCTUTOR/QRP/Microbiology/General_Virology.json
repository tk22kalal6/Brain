      "solution": "<p>Poxvirus is recognized as the largest DNA virus. It belongs to the Poxviridae family and is notable for its complex and large brick-shaped structure. The genome of Poxviruses is linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), which can be as large as 200-300 kilobase pairs, making it significantly larger than other DNA viruses. The Poxvirus family includes viruses that cause diseases such as smallpox and cowpox.</p><br><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3d535v34tlady.cloudfront.net/V3/NEETPGMCQ/202412070bd61a2c-fa1b-4fee-a4f8-fc30a4f6b334.jpg\"><p>Other DNA viruses mentioned:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Adenovirus</strong>: Medium-sized DNA virus, known for causing respiratory infections and conjunctivitis.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Herpesvirus</strong>: A family of large DNA viruses that include herpes simplex, varicella-zoster (causes chickenpox), and Epstein-Barr virus, but not as large as Poxvirus.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Parvovirus</strong>: The smallest DNA virus, with a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) genome.

Segmented RNA viruses have their genetic material divided into distinct segments, each coding for different proteins. Rotavirus has a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genome, with 11 segments in total.

      "solution": "<p><strong>A) Helical</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Explanation:</strong> Helical viruses have a shape where the nucleic acid is wrapped around a cylindrical protein coat, forming a helical structure.

Bacteriophages, with their complex structure including a head and tail, are an example. Influenza viruses are not classified as complex.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>D) Spherical</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Explanation:</strong> Influenza viruses are classified as spherical in shape.
