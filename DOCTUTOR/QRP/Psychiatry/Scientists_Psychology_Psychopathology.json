      "solution": "<ul>\r\n<li>Conservation is the ability to understand that objects maintain certain characteristics despite changes in shape. For instance, when a ball of clay is rolled into a long sausage shape, children recognize that both forms contain the same amount of clay. Inability to conserve, typical of the preoperational stage, is seen when a child thinks the sausage has more clay because it is longer.</li>\r\n<li>Reversibility refers to the understanding that <strong>one thing can change into another and back again, such as ice transforming into water.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Option A: Sensorimotor stage: </strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Piaget's sensorimotor stage describes how <strong>infants learn through sensory observation and motor control, </strong>divided into six substages. Infants blend biology and experience to form learned behaviours, such as adapting their sucking reflex to locate a nipple. They develop schemas-basic concepts formed through interaction.</li>\r\n<li>A critical achievement is object permanence, the understanding that objects exist independently of perception, allowing infants to search for dropped items. Around 18 months, they begin to develop <strong><strong>symbolization</strong></strong>, using mental images and words to represent objects. This transition marks the shift from the sensorimotor stage to the preoperational stage of development.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Option B: Preoperational thought stage:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>During the Preoperational stage, <strong>children use symbols and language but think intuitively, lacking logical reasoning. </strong>They name objects but struggle with categories and cause and effect; for instance, they might believe a broken glass was meant to break. They perceive the same object in different contexts as separate items and define things by their functions, like calling a bike \"to ride\" and a hole \"to dig.\"</li>\r\n<li>In the <strong>preoperational stage,</strong> children struggle with moral dilemmas and often judge guilt based on quantity rather than intent, believing that more broken dishes mean more guilt. They hold a sense of immanent justice, thinking punishment for bad deeds is inevitable.</li>\r\n<li>Egocentric in their thinking, children cannot understand others' perspectives and struggle to modify their behaviour for others. They also engage in magical thinking, believing events that occur together cause one another (e.g., thunder causes lightning) and exhibit animistic thinking, attributing life-like qualities to objects and events.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Option C: Concrete operations:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>In the concrete operations stage, <strong>children interact with the tangible world and develop operational thought, allowing them to see others' perspectives. </strong>They begin using limited logical reasoning, can serialize and classify objects, and understand syllogistic reasoning (e.g., all horses are mammals; therefore, all horses are warm-blooded). This stage also fosters self-regulation and the development of a moral sense.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Option D: Formal Operations: </strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The formal operations stage involves <strong>highly logical, systematic, and abstract thinking. Adolescents can reason deductively, grasp probabilities, and explore complex issues like philosophy and ethics.</strong> They develop hypotheticodeductive thinking, allowing them to form and test hypotheses.</li>\r\n<li>While they reflect on their own and others' thoughts, adolescents may show self-consciousness and occasionally revert to egocentric thinking. Not all adolescents enter this stage simultaneously or to the same degree; some may remain in the concrete operational stage throughout their lives.</li>\r\n</ul>",

      "solution": "<ul>\r\n<li>A key achievement during the sensorimotor stage is <strong>object permanence,</strong> which means that infants learn that objects still exist even when they can't see them. They begin to understand that they are separate from the world around them and can mentally hold an image of an object that is out of sight. For example, if they drop a toy, they will look for it, showing they recognize it exists independently.</li>\r\n<li>Piaget's ideas have important implications for mental health. Children in the sensorimotor stage, like those in hospitals, often experience <strong>separation anxiety because they haven't yet developed object permanence.</strong> They feel more secure when their mothers stay with them overnight.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Option A: Immanent Justice: </strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Children in the preoperational stage struggle with moral dilemmas, even though they understand good and bad feelings.</li>\r\n<li>For example, when asked who is more guilty- someone who breaks one dish on purpose or someone who breaks ten dishes by accident-young children often think the person who broke ten dishes is more guilty because more were broken.</li>\r\n<li>They also believe in immanent justice, thinking that bad actions will always lead to punishment.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Option B: Reversibility:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Reversibility is the ability to understand that things can change and then change back. </strong></li>\r\n<li>For example, kids can see that ice can turn into water, and then water can freeze back into ice.</li>\r\n<li>This understanding usually develops in children between the ages of 7 and 11 during the concrete operational stage.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Option C: Egocentric: </strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Children in the preoperational stage are <strong>egocentric,</strong> meaning they see everything from their own perspective and find it hard to understand others' views.</li>\r\n<li>For example, if a child is told to be quiet because their sibling is studying, they might not listen because they can't see how their noise affects their sibling.</li>\r\n<li>They focus only on their own feelings and needs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Option D: Object Permanence:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Hospitalized children in the sensorimotor stage have not achieved object permanence and, therefore, have separation anxiety</li>\r\n</ul>",

Without this secure base, a child's development suffers.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Option D: Theory of Narcissism</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Freud used the term narcissism, derived from the Greek myth of Narcissus, to describe when an individual's libido is focused on the ego rather than others.</li>\r\n<li>This concept complicated his instinct theory, leading him to connect it with various psychiatric disorders and even normal development, emphasizing inward libidinal withdrawal.</li>\r\n</ul>",

Memories may be repressed or unacknowledged, but this does not equate to being able to recall them.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option D: The existence of an inner voice or thought.</strong><br />The unconscious, as described by Jaspers, does not involve conscious thoughts or an inner voice.
