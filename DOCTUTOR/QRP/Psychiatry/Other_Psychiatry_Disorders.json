The memory issues in depression are usually related to concentration and attention, not to the dramatic memory loss seen in dissociative amnesia.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option B: Transient global amnesia</strong></p>\r\n<p>This is incorrect. Transient global amnesia involves sudden, temporary memory loss, but it is a distinct condition characterized by <strong>anterograde amnesia</strong> (inability to form new memories) and some retrograde amnesia. Dissociative amnesia, on the other hand, is tied to trauma and involves the <strong>loss of autobiographical memories.</strong> While both conditions involve memory loss, they have different causes and mechanisms.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option C: Acute stress disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder</strong></p>\r\n<p>This is the correct answer. Both acute stress disorder (ASD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are trauma-related conditions, and dissociative amnesia can often be a co-occurring diagnosis. People who have experienced trauma may have difficulty recalling specific traumatic events or details surrounding them, which is characteristic of dissociative amnesia.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option D: Substance use disorder</strong></p>\r\n<p>This is incorrect. While certain substances, such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, can cause memory loss (especially blackout episodes), dissociative amnesia is not typically associated with substance use disorder. Memory loss in substance use disorder is usually due to intoxication or withdrawal, rather than dissociative amnesia.</p>\r\n<p><strong>KEY TAKEAWAYS: Differential Diagnosis of amnesia:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Ordinary forgetfulness:</strong> Distinct from dissociative amnesia, as it does not involve significant trauma or overwhelming stress.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Dementia, delirium, and amnestic disorders:</strong> Memory loss in these conditions involves broader cognitive dysfunction, not just memory of personal identity.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Posttraumatic amnesia:</strong> Related to physical trauma (e.g., brain injury), involves objective evidence of brain injury.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Seizure disorders:</strong> Seizures may cause wandering or amnesia but typically involve more clear-cut ictal events and postictal states.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Substance-related amnesia:</strong> Memory impairment caused by substances like alcohol, narcotics, or sedative-hypnotics.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Transient global amnesia:</strong> Sudden onset of memory loss (anterograde and some retrograde), but <strong>preserved personal identity.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Option A: Factitious Disorder</strong></p>\r\n<p>This is the correct diagnosis. Factitious Disorder is characterized by <strong>intentionally feigning or inducing physical or psychological symptoms in oneself to assume the sick role, without any external gain.</strong></p>\r\n<p>In this case, the patient has a long history of frequent hospitalizations for unexplained symptoms, inconsistent reporting of his medical history, and a clear lack of physical findings to explain his complaints. Additionally, his profession in healthcare raises suspicion, as people in this field sometimes feign illness to assume the sick role.</p>\r\n<p>The absence of an external gain, like financial benefit or avoidance of responsibilities (as seen in malingering), further supports the diagnosis of Factitious Disorder.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option B: Malingering:</strong> Malingering involves <strong>feigning illness or injury for external gain,</strong> such as financial compensation, avoidance of work, or legal outcomes. While the patient in this scenario may appear to be faking symptoms, there is no clear external motivation like financial or legal benefit. The patient's genuine distress and long history of hospital visits without an identifiable physical cause make malingering less likely.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option C: Somatic Symptom Disorder:</strong> Somatic Symptom Disorder involves excessive <strong>anxiety and distress about real physical symptoms,</strong> which can be unexplained or partially explained by a medical condition. However, the intentional creation or exaggeration of symptoms seen in Factitious Disorder is not a feature of Somatic Symptom Disorder. This patient's symptoms appear to be purposefully induced, which aligns more with Factitious Disorder rather than Somatic Symptom Disorder.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option D: Conversion Disorder:</strong> Conversion Disorder (also known as <strong>Functional Neurologic Symptom Disorder<strong>) </strong></strong>involves neurological symptoms, such as paralysis, blindness, or non-epileptic seizures, which are not explained by medical conditions. The patient's symptoms, such as abdominal pain and vomiting, are not typical of Conversion Disorder, which typically involves neurological deficits rather than generalized somatic complaints. Moreover, the patient's symptoms are likely fabricated, not arising from a neurological cause, which rules out Conversion Disorder.</p>\r\n<p><strong>KEY TAKEAWAYS: FACTITIOUS DISORDER (IMPOSED ON SELF OR ANOTHER)</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Symptoms:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Fabricates symptoms </strong>or <strong>induces illness</strong> in self or another.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Claims to be ill </strong>or feigns injury.</li>\r\n<li>Misleads healthcare professionals.</li>\r\n<li><strong>No external motivation</strong>(other than assuming the sick role).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Specifiers:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Factitious disorder imposed on self:</strong> Individual fakes illness or injury.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Factitious disorder imposed on another:</strong> Faking symptoms in another person (often a caregiver causing harm to a dependent person).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Exclusions:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Not due to another <strong>mental disorder </strong>or <strong>malingering.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Option A: Dissociative Identity Disorder</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Explanation: </strong>Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) is characterized by the presence of <strong>at least two distinct personality states, each with its own distinct affect, behavior, memory, perception, and self-control. </strong>While the patient in the question has symptoms of detachment from herself, which might appear dissociative, DID involves a much more complex presentation where there are distinct identities with unique memories, behaviors, and affects. The patient does not report experiencing multiple personalities, making DID unlikely in this case.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option B: Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Explanation: </strong>This patient most likely has Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder. The key symptoms are <strong>feelings of detachment from oneself (depersonalization) and a sense of unreality, which the patient describes when she feels like she is observing herself.</strong> This disorder involves a persistent or recurrent experience of depersonalization, where a person feels detached from their body or thoughts, or <strong>derealization, where the surroundings feel unreal. The patient's distorted perceptions, including time distortion and detachment from surroundings,</strong> fit this diagnosis. These symptoms must cause significant distress and impairment, as seen in her difficulties at work.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option C: Schizophrenia </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Explanation: </strong>Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder characterized by <strong>hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, and negative symptoms (e.g., lack of motivation, emotional flattening).</strong> Although derealization or depersonalization might occur in schizophrenia as part of psychotic symptoms, the patient in the question does not exhibit other core symptoms of schizophrenia (such as hallucinations or delusions). Her intact reality testing-the ability to recognize that her perceptions are not real-also rules out schizophrenia, which is associated with a break from reality.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option D: Somatic Symptom Disorder </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Somatic Symptom Disorder involves <strong>excessive worry and preoccupation with physical symptoms, often leading to frequent healthcare visits and emotional distress.</strong> While the patient does report distress, the nature of her symptoms is more related to perceptions of detachment and unreality, not physical complaints. Additionally, somatic symptoms are not the primary focus of her distress, so Somatic Symptom Disorder is unlikely to be the correct diagnosis here.</p>\r\n<p><strong>KEY TAKEAWAYS: Depersonalization</strong> involves the feeling of being detached from oneself.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Derealization </strong>involves the feeling that the external world is unreal.</li>\r\n<li><strong>DID </strong>involves the presence of distinct identities, with memory lapses for actions performed by these identities.</li>\r\n<li>Both conditions lead to significant <strong>distress </strong>and <strong>functional impairment.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Option A: Voyeuristic Disorder</strong></p>\r\n<p>Voyeuristic Disorder is characterized by <strong>sexual arousal from observing unsuspecting individuals who are naked, undressing, or engaging in sexual activity.</strong> The patient in this case has a persistent preoccupation with watching strangers undress or engage in sexual activity, masturbating during or after these events, and feels significant distress due to his behaviour. This matches the criteria for Voyeuristic Disorder as outlined in the DSM-5.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option B: Exhibitionistic Disorder</strong></p>\r\n<p>Exhibitionistic Disorder involves the urge to <strong>expose one's genitals to unsuspecting individuals.</strong> The focus is on exposing one's genitals to others for sexual arousal, often in public settings. In contrast, this patient's behaviour is about watching others, not exposing himself, which makes Exhibitionistic Disorder an inappropriate diagnosis for this case.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option C: Fetishistic Disorder</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Fetishistic Disorder involves sexual arousal and fantasies centered around specific objects or nongenital body parts (such as shoes, stockings, or feet).</strong> While this disorder involves a fixation on non-human stimuli, it does not align with the patient's behaviour, which is focused on observing others in intimate situations rather than being aroused by objects or body parts. Therefore, Fetishistic Disorder is not the right diagnosis here.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option D: Sexual Sadism Disorder</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Sexual Sadism Disorder involves sexual arousal from the infliction of pain or suffering on another person, either physically or psychologically.</strong> The key feature of sexual sadism is the desire to harm or dominate others, but in this case, the patient is not seeking to harm others. Instead, his primary behaviour is observing others in intimate situations. Thus, Sexual Sadism Disorder does not fit this patient's presentation.</p>\r\n<p><strong>KEY TAKEAWAYS: VOYEURISTIC DISORDER</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Voyeurism:</strong> Sexual arousal from <strong>observing unsuspecting individuals </strong>engage in intimate activities like undressing or having sex.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Masturbation </strong>typically occurs after the act.</li>\r\n<li>The condition is more common in <strong>men,</strong> and the first <strong>voyeuristic act </strong>typically happens during <strong>childhood.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>",
