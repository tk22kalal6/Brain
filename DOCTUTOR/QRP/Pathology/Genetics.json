      "solution": "<p>Cleft lip and cleft palate exemplify <strong>multifactorial inheritance </strong>in which multiple genes interact with various environmental factors to produce disease.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On the <u>35th day of gestation</u>, the <strong>frontal prominence fuses with the maxillary process</strong> to form the upper lip.</li>\n<li>Disturbances in gene expression at this time (hereditary or environmental) &agrave; interference with proper fusion and result in <strong>cleft lip, with or without cleft palate. </strong></li>\n<li>In addition to multifactorial inheritance, this developmental anomaly may be part of a malformation syndrome caused by teratogens (e.g., rubella and anticonvulsants).</li>\n<li>That is often encountered in children with <strong>chromosomal abnormalities</strong> (correct answer).</li>\n<li>Seen in <strong>PATAU SYNDROME (TRISOMY 13).</strong></li>\n<li>The incidence of cleft lip, with or without cleft palate, is 1 in 1,000, and the incidence of cleft palate alone is 1 in 2,500.</li>\n<li>If one child is born with a cleft lip, the chances are 4% that the second child will exhibit the same defect.</li>\n<li>If the first two children are affected, the risk of cleft lip increases to 9% for the third child. The more severe the anatomical defect, the greater the probability of transmitting cleft lip will be.</li>\n<li>Whereas 75% of cases of cleft lip occur in boys, the sons of women with cleft lip have a four times higher risk of acquiring the defect than the sons of affected fathers.</li>\n<li>None of the other choices are associated with a significantly increased risk of cleft lip.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways: </strong>Cleft lip and palate are primarily caused by multifactorial inheritance, where both genetic and environmental factors play a role. Chromosomal abnormalities, such as Patau syndrome (trisomy 13), can also cause these defects. The risk of recurrence in future pregnancies increases with the severity of the defect and is higher if the first child is affected.</p>",
