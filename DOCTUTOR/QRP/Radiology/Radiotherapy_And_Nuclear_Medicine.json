Cellular Effects</strong></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Cell Death</strong>: High doses of ionizing radiation can lead to direct cell death, particularly in rapidly dividing cells, such as those in bone marrow and gastrointestinal lining.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Mutations</strong>: Ionizing radiation can cause DNA damage, leading to mutations that may result in cancer or hereditary effects.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><strong>2. Tissue and Organ Effects</strong></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS)</strong>: Exposure to high doses over a short period can cause ARS, which affects multiple organ systems. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and potentially death.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Radiation-Induced Fibrosis</strong>: Long-term exposure can lead to fibrosis in tissues such as lung, skin, or connective tissues, affecting their function.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Cataracts</strong>: Exposure to ionizing radiation can lead to the formation of <strong>cataracts</strong>in the eyes.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><strong>3. Systemic Effects</strong></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Hematopoietic Effects</strong>: Radiation can affect bone marrow, leading to decreased blood cell production, <strong>resulting in anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia</strong>.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Gastrointestinal Effects</strong>: Damage to the lining of the gastrointestinal tract can lead to severe gastrointestinal distress, malabsorption, and increased susceptibility to infections.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><strong>4. Long-term Effects</strong></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Cancer</strong>: Ionizing radiation is a known carcinogen. Long-term exposure, even at low doses, increases the risk of various cancers, including leukemia, thyroid cancer, and solid tumors.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Heritable Effects</strong>: Genetic mutations caused by radiation can potentially be passed onto future generations, leading to hereditary conditions.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><strong>5.
