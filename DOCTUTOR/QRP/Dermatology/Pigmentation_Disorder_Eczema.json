      "solution": "<p>Chikungunya can lead to hyperpigmentation over the nose, called a chick sign. This pigmentation is not related to drugs.</p>\r\n<p>Chikungunya fever, a viral infection transmitted by mosquitoes, can sometimes lead to a unique skin manifestation known as the \"chick sign.\" This is a type of <strong>hyperpigmentation</strong> that appears as a dark patch over the nose.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Key points about the \"chick sign\" in chikungunya:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Unrelated to drug intake:</strong> Unlike other forms of hyperpigmentation, the \"chick sign\" is not associated with drug reactions or other underlying diseases.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Follow fever and joint pain:</strong> It typically appears after the initial phase of fever and joint pain, which are common symptoms of chikungunya.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Distinct appearance:</strong> The \"chick sign\" is characterized by a dark, well-defined patch over the nose.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Option A: </strong>Melasma is not related to fever or NSAIDS intake. It is commonly seen in females. Risk factors are photo exposure, hormonal imbalance or oc pill intake.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option B: </strong>FDR is a drug reaction. Vesicles or bullae develop over skin or mucosa which leaves hyperpigmentation. It recur over the same site if drug exposure occurs.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option D:</strong> Dengue rash are erythema with a typical appearance of 'islands of white in sea of red'. Petechial rash may develop if platelets counts are low.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway: </strong></p>\r\n<p>Chikungunya fever can cause hyperpigmentation over the nose, known as the \"chick sign,\" which is unrelated to drug intake. This condition typically follows fever and joint pain and is distinct from other forms of hyperpigmentation associated with drug reactions or other diseases.</p>\r\n<p>Reference: Seetharam KA, Sridevi K, Vidyasagar P.
