Patients may exhibit confusion, agitation, and hallucinations, which can lead to dangerous behavior.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Datura's Pharmacology</strong>: The seeds contain <strong>tropane alkaloids</strong> like atropine and scopolamine, which block the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, leading to a variety of physiological effects, including dilated pupils and decreased secretions.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Anticholinergic Symptoms</strong>: Other symptoms of Datura poisoning include <strong>dry mouth</strong>, increased heart rate (tachycardia), urinary retention, flushed skin, and decreased bowel sounds, all typical of anticholinergic toxicity.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Psychological Effects</strong>: The psychological manifestations can include <strong>hallucinations</strong>, agitation, and sometimes, violent behaviour due to the profound CNS effects of the poison.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Why Not Other Options</strong>:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>c.
