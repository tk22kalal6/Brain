Elective Caesarean section at 38 weeks</strong>: Although a cesarean section can be indicated in certain cases, it is not necessary in this scenario unless <strong>there are specific obstetric indications (such as fetal distress or malpresentation).</strong> Since the fetal status is reassuring and her diabetes is well-controlled, induction of labor is a safer approach.</p>\r\n<p><strong>D. Wait for spontaneous labour</strong>: Given the previous history of fetal demise, waiting for spontaneous labor is not advisable. It increases the risk of recurrence of adverse outcomes, particularly in a diabetic patient.</p>\r\n<p><strong>KEY TAKEAWAY: Induction of labour at 38 weeks</strong> allows for a safe delivery before the potential risks associated with post-term pregnancy and further complications can arise, particularly in a diabetic patient like macrosomia and shoulder dystocia can occur.</p>",

Parenteral iron is typically <em>avoided in beta-thalassemia unless there is documented iron deficiency because iron overload can be a problem in thalassemia patients</em>, especially those requiring frequent transfusions.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>b) Iron chelation therapy should be stopped and folate supplementation should be given</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Correct. Iron chelation therapy, such as with deferoxamine, is usually stopped during pregnancy due to potential teratogenic effects</strong>, and <strong>folate supplementation is important for both maternal and fetal health.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>c) Pneumococcal vaccination and boosters are advised prior to pregnancy</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Correct.
