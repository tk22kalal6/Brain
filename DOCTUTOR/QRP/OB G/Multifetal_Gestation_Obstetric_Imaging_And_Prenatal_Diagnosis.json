      "solution": "<p>This is the most definitive test for proving monozygosity. The DNA microprobe technique involves comparing the twins' genetic material at a very detailed level. Monozygotic twins will have identical DNA sequences, while dizygotic twins will not. This test is accurate and non-invasive, making it the gold standard for determining monozygosity.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Most definitive test to prove monozygosity in twins:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>OPTION a. Same gender</strong>:<br /> Twins of the same gender could either be monozygotic (identical) or dizygotic (fraternal). While <em>all monozygotic twins are of the same gender, dizygotic twins can also share the same gender.</em> Hence, this is not a definitive test to prove monozygosity.</p>\r\n<p><strong>OPTION b. Same blood group</strong>:<br /> <em>Although monozygotic twins generally have the same blood group, dizygotic twins can also occasionally share the same blood group.</em> Therefore, this is not a conclusive test for proving monozygosity.</p>\r\n<p><strong>OPTION c. Test skin graft</strong>:<br /> Skin grafting between monozygotic twins tends to be accepted because their tissues are genetically identical. However, <em>this method is invasive and not commonly used in modern practice to determine zygosity. </em>It is not considered definitive due to ethical and practical concerns.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KEY TAKE AWAY:-</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>Monozygotic twins</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Sex: While <em>twins having opposite sex are almost always dizygotic</em> and twins of the same sex are not always monozygotic but the uniovular twins are always of the same sex. If the fetuses are of the same sex and have the same genetic features (dominant blood group), monozygosity is likely.</li>\r\n<li>A test skin graft-<em>Acceptance of reciprocal skin graft </em>is almost a certain proof of monozygosity.</li>\r\n<li><strong><em>DNA microprobe technique is most definitive</em></strong></li>\r\n<li>Follow-up study between 2 and 4 years-<em>showing almost similar physical and behavioural features suggestive of monozygosity.</em></li>\r\n</ul>",

At 26 weeks of gestation, her USG report showed one live and active fetus of 26 weeks 2 days and other was dead. Patient's attendants were counselled regarding the condition and risks upon continuation of pregnancy to the mother and fetus were explained. Conservative management was done with sonography every three weeks and coagulation profile every fortnight. At the time of admission, General Physical examination was normal. Obstetric examination revealed fundal height corresponding to term gestation, single fetus with cephalic presentation with FHR 148 bpm. Per vaginal examination showed cervical dilation of 2 cm. USG done showed oligohydraminos (AFI=3). Emergency caeserean section was performed; a live term IUGR female baby of 2.2kg was delivered.

TRAP syndrome (Twin Reversed Arterial Perfusion syndrome):</strong></p>\r\n<p>TRAP syndrome is a rare complication of monochorionic twin pregnancies where one twin (the \"acardiac twin\") develops without a heart and other critical structures, while the other twin (the \"pump twin\") provides blood to both fetuses. The pump twin is at risk of heart failure due to the increased cardiovascular load. The acardiac twin usually has severe malformations and is non-viable.</p>\r\n<p><strong>b. TTTS (Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome):</strong></p>\r\n<p>TTTS occurs in monochorionic twin pregnancies where the twins share a single placenta. Due to abnormal vascular connections within the placenta, blood flows disproportionately between the twins, causing one twin (the donor) to have reduced blood volume and amniotic fluid, while the other twin (the recipient) receives excess blood, which can lead to heart problems and polyhydramnios. Without treatment, TTTS can result in serious complications for both twins.</p>\r\n<p><strong>d. Fetus in fetu:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Fetus in fetu is a rare condition in which a malformed fetus is found inside the body of its twin. This abnormality occurs during early embryonic development, when one twin becomes trapped within the other. The \"fetus\" in this case is not viable and is often detected as a mass in the body of the surviving twin. Surgical removal is generally required, but it is a benign condition.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KEY TAKE AWAY:-</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>Fetus papyraceus refers to the condition where <em>one twin in a multiple pregnancy dies in utero </em>early in the pregnancy and is <em>compressed by the growth of the surviving twin</em>, becoming flattened and mummified.
