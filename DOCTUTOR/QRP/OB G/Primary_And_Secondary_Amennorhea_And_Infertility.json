      "solution": "<p>A uniformly enlarged uterus with a heterogeneous myometrium on ultrasound.</p>\r\n<p><strong>OPTION A:</strong> Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas) are benign smooth muscle tumors of the uterus. Symptoms can include heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pressure, and pain, <em>but the uterus is usually not uniformly enlarged, and the myometrium typically appears heterogeneous only in areas where the fibroids are located.</em> The clinical presentation and imaging findings in this case are more consistent with adenomyosis than fibroids.</p>\r\n<p><strong>OPTION C:</strong> Endometriosis is the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, commonly involving the ovaries, pelvic peritoneum, and other structures. It can cause chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia, similar to adenomyosis. However, <em>endometriosis typically does not cause a uniformly enlarged uterus or a heterogeneous myometrium on ultrasound.</em> Instead, it may show endometriomas (chocolate cysts) on the ovaries or adhesions. Therefore, while endometriosis is in the differential for chronic pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea, the ultrasound findings in this case are more indicative of adenomyosis.</p>\r\n<p><strong>OPTION D:</strong> Primary dysmenorrhea is menstrual pain without an underlying pelvic pathology, usually starting within a few years of menarche. It typically presents with crampy lower abdominal pain during menstruation but without chronic pelvic pain or dyspareunia. Additionally, <em>primary dysmenorrhea would not cause an enlarged uterus or the heterogeneous myometrium seen on ultrasound</em>.
