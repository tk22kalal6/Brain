To minimize this risk, disengagement of the fetal head during amniotomy is avoided.</strong> Some clinicians prefer to rupture membranes during a contraction. In many of these cases, however, membranes tear and fluid is lost rapidly. <strong>Because of the risk of cord prolapse, or rarely placental abruption, the fetal heart rate is assessed before and immediately after amniotomy</strong>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Option-wise Explanation:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>a. Abruptio placentae</strong>: Abruptio placentae refers to premature separation of the placenta, typically associated with vaginal bleeding and uterine tenderness. <strong>The clear liquor in this case makes abruptio placentae less likely, </strong>and the sudden fetal heart rate (FHR) decelerations without other signs of placental abruption further reduce the likelihood of this diagnosis.</li>\r\n<li><strong>c. Vasa previa</strong>: Vasa previa involves fetal blood vessels traversing the membranes near the cervix, which can rupture during labor, leading to fetal bleeding. <strong>However, vasa previa would be expected to cause blood-stained amniotic fluid, not clear liquor,</strong> and typically results in rapid fetal exsanguination, not just decelerations.</li>\r\n<li><strong>d.
