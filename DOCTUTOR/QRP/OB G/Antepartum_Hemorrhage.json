Nulliparity (having never given birth before) is <strong>not</strong> typically considered a risk factor for placental abruption.

Non-vertex presentation</strong>: This statement is <strong>true</strong>. Non-vertex presentations (e.g., breech presentation) can increase the risk of placental abruption, as abnormal positioning may lead to increased mechanical stress on the placenta during labor.</li>\r\n<li><strong>c. Low BMI</strong>: This statement is <strong>true</strong>. A low body mass index (BMI) has been associated with an increased risk of placental abruption, potentially due to inadequate nutritional status or other related factors.</li>\r\n<li><strong>d. PROM (Premature Rupture of Membranes)</strong>: This statement is <strong>true</strong>.

      "solution": "<p>Vasa previa occurs when fetal blood vessels run across the cervical os beneath the fetal membranes. If these vessels rupture during ARM, it can lead to significant fetal hemorrhage, which can explain the fresh bleeding and the <strong>late decelerations</strong> observed on CTG. This is the most likely cause of the bleeding in this case.</p>\r\n<p>Optionwise explanation:</p>\r\n<p><strong>a. Bleeding from succenturiate lobe</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: A succenturiate lobe is an additional lobe of placental tissue that can be present but typically does not cause bleeding unless it separates or if there are complications during delivery. In this scenario, the fresh bleeding on ARM and late decelerations indicate a more critical condition.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>c.</strong> <strong>Battledore placenta</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: Battledore placenta refers to a placenta with an abnormal insertion of the umbilical cord at the margin of the placenta. While it can cause complications, it is less likely to directly cause acute bleeding during labor or ARM.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>d. Cervical polyp</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: A cervical polyp could potentially cause bleeding, but it is usually associated with less severe bleeding and does not typically cause late decelerations in fetal heart rate patterns.

Abruptio placentae</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: Abruptio placentae is a serious condition where the placenta detaches from the uterus prematurely, leading to maternal hemorrhage and possible fetal distress. However, the blood loss primarily affects the mother, not fetal exsanguination directly.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>b.
