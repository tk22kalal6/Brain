H&uuml;rthle cell carcinomas do not typically take up RAI, and total thyroidectomy is necessary for invasive disease, regardless of RAI uptake.</p>\r\n<p>Option B) Incorrect. Lobectomy and isthmectomy are sufficient only for unilateral, non-invasive H&uuml;rthle cell adenomas. Invasive carcinoma requires total thyroidectomy.</p>\r\n<p>Option C) Incorrect. H&uuml;rthle cell carcinoma is a subtype of follicular thyroid carcinoma, not papillary thyroid carcinoma, and cannot be diagnosed definitively by FNAB due to the need to identify capsular or vascular invasion.</p>\r\n<p>Option D) Correct.
