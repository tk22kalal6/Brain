This occurs when the posterior capsule is breached, leading to loss of the normal barrier between the anterior and posterior segments of the eye. The immediate result is <strong>shallowing of the anterior chamber</strong>, loss of the red reflex, and potential forward movement of the vitreous. Surgeons must immediately stabilize the situation, often converting to a <strong>vitrectomy</strong> to remove prolapsed vitreous before proceeding.</li>\n<li><strong>B) Anterior chamber collapse due to insufficient irrigation:</strong> Incorrect: While insufficient irrigation could lead to a shallow anterior chamber, it does not typically cause loss of the red reflex. The lack of irrigation may result from a <strong>malfunctioning irrigation system</strong> or inadequate infusion settings, but this would usually lead to instability and chamber fluctuations rather than the sudden loss of the red reflex, which is more indicative of a posterior capsule issue.</li>\n<li><strong>C) Phaco tip occlusion leading to rise in intraocular pressure:Incorrect:</strong> <strong>Occlusion of the phaco tip</strong> can increase intraocular pressure temporarily if the fluid outflow is blocked, but this would not lead to <strong>anterior chamber shallowing</strong> or loss of red reflex. Phaco tip occlusion usually manifests with a change in the pitch of the phaco machine sound and an immediate rise in resistance while emulsifying nuclear fragments.</li>\n<li><strong>D) Decentered intraocular lens insertion:Incorrect:</strong> Decentration of the <strong>intraocular lens (IOL)</strong> occurs during the IOL placement stage, typically <strong>after nuclear emulsification</strong> has been completed. It would not explain the shallow anterior chamber and loss of red reflex during the nuclear disassembly phase of surgery.

      "solution": "<ul>\n<li><strong>B) Incomplete laser capsulotomy with tags remaining at the capsule edge:</strong> One of the potential complications of <strong>FLACS</strong> is an <strong>incomplete capsulotomy</strong>, where small tags or attachments remain at the edge of the capsular opening. These tags can <strong>prevent complete separation of the anterior capsule, making the lens nucleus less mobile during surgery.</strong> This can lead to difficulty in nuclear disassembly and manipulation. The best way to address this issue intraoperatively is to use a <strong>manual capsulorhexis forceps</strong> to carefully complete the capsulotomy, ensuring full separation of the capsule before proceeding with phacoemulsification.</li>\n<li><strong>A) Insufficient capsulotomy overlap with the IOL:</strong> Insufficient overlap of the capsulotomy with the IOL edge typically affects <strong>postoperative IOL centration</strong> but does not directly impact the mobility of the nucleus during nuclear disassembly. This is more of a long-term concern for IOL stability, rather than an intraoperative issue causing nuclear rigidity.</li>\n<li><strong>C) Misalignment of the femto laser during lens fragmentation:</strong> Misalignment of the <strong>femtosecond laser</strong> could result in incomplete or inefficient lens fragmentation, but this would manifest as difficulties in breaking down the nucleus into fragments rather than immobility of the entire lens. Proper alignment during preoperative imaging and laser application usually prevents this.</li>\n<li><strong>D) Increased intra-lenticular pressure due to incomplete hydrodissection:</strong> <strong>Incomplete hydrodissection</strong> can result in lens retention and make nuclear disassembly more difficult, but this is less common in FLACS, where the laser assists with fragmentation. If hydrodissection is incomplete, gentle reinjection of fluid can free the nucleus and improve mobility. However, this is less likely to be the primary cause compared to an incomplete capsulotomy in this scenario.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>KEY TAKEAWAYS: </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Common Complications in FLACS:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Difficulty with nuclear rotation</strong>: Laser fragmentation of the nucleus sometimes leaves the nucleus less mobile, requiring careful hydrodissection or viscodissection to free it.</li>\n<li><strong>Tags or tears</strong> at the edge of the capsulotomy can lead to intraoperative complications like posterior capsular rupture if not addressed early.</li>\n<li><strong>Incomplete laser capsulotomy</strong>: Sometimes, the laser may not completely cut through the entire circumference of the anterior capsule, leaving small capsular tags that need to be manually completed.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Management Strategies:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>In the case of <strong>incomplete capsulotomy</strong>, it is crucial to carefully complete the capsulotomy with manual forceps before proceeding to phacoemulsification. This prevents unintentional tears that may lead to <strong>posterior capsular rupture</strong>.</li>\n<li>For <strong>dense nuclear cataracts</strong>, the femto laser can be set to create deeper and more numerous segmentation lines to facilitate easier nucleus disassembly.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Post-operative Outcomes:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>FLACS has been shown to improve <strong>visual outcomes</strong> and reduce <strong>phaco time</strong> and <strong>energy</strong>. However, careful intraoperative management of capsulotomy and lens fragmentation is essential to avoid complications such as <strong>capsular tears</strong> or <strong>IOL decentration</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3d535v34tlady.cloudfront.net/V3/NEETPGMCQ/20250111ed0fa910-2bf5-476d-ae5c-8325b89e933f.jpg\"><br>\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3d535v34tlady.cloudfront.net/V3/NEETPGMCQ/202501113d891bd0-9712-49f6-894f-cb9e89153b3b.jpg\">\n<p>A- Nucleus divided in four quadrant and capsulorhexis done by Femto</p>\n<p>B- removal of capsule</p>\n<p>C- phacoemulsification</p>\n<p>D- cortex irrigation</p>",

This is a sight-threatening emergency. The most effective treatment is the <strong>intravitreal administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics</strong> (such as vancomycin and ceftazidime) to target the common causative organisms (gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria).<br />In cases of <strong>severe visual loss</strong> (e.g., hand motion vision or worse), <strong>pars plana vitrectomy</strong> is indicated to remove the infectious material and inflammatory debris, helping to clear the infection and preserve vision.</li>\n<li><strong>B) Immediate oral antibiotics and corticosteroids:</strong> Oral antibiotics are not recommended as first-line therapy for <strong>acute endophthalmitis</strong> because they do not reach adequate intraocular levels quickly enough to control the infection. Similarly, systemic corticosteroids are contraindicated in the acute infectious phase of endophthalmitis. Corticosteroids might be considered later in conjunction with antibiotic therapy to control inflammation, but intravitreal antibiotics are the initial priority.</li>\n<li><strong>C) Topical antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drops:</strong> While topical antibiotics and steroids may help control anterior segment inflammation, they are not sufficient to treat a <strong>sight-threatening intraocular infection</strong> like endophthalmitis.

Intravitreal antibiotics provide the highest local concentration to combat the infection.

      "solution": "<ul>\n<li><strong>A) Timing of surgery:</strong> The most critical factor in managing <strong>pediatric cataracts</strong>, especially in infants, is the <strong>timing of surgery</strong>. Visual development in infants is highly sensitive during the first few months of life. If the cataract is dense and affects the visual axis (as in this case), it is essential to remove the cataract as early as possible, ideally between <strong>4 to 6 weeks of age</strong> for unilateral cases. Delayed intervention significantly increases the risk of <strong>amblyopia</strong> (stimulus deprivation amblyopia), which can lead to permanent visual impairment despite later surgery.</li>\n<li><strong>B) Choice of intraocular lens (IOL):</strong> While the choice of IOL is important, it is secondary to the timing of surgery. In infants under <strong>6 months</strong>, the decision to implant an IOL or opt for <strong>aphakia</strong> followed by contact lens correction depends on factors like ocular growth and risk of postoperative complications (e.g., glaucoma). Typically, IOLs are implanted in older children after careful consideration, but the visual axis must first be cleared through timely surgery.</li>\n<li><strong>C) Risk of postoperative glaucoma:</strong> The risk of <strong>glaucoma</strong> after pediatric cataract surgery is higher in younger children, particularly in those operated on in infancy. However, while monitoring for glaucoma is essential, it is a longer-term complication. The immediate focus should be on preventing amblyopia through timely surgery and optical rehabilitation.</li>\n<li><strong>D) Postoperative amblyopia therapy:</strong> <strong>Amblyopia therapy</strong>, such as <strong>patching</strong> the better eye or using <strong>atropine</strong>, is crucial following pediatric cataract surgery. However, amblyopia therapy is only effective if the cataract is addressed in time to prevent stimulus deprivation. Early surgery to restore visual input is the priority, followed by aggressive amblyopia treatment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>KEY TAKEAWAYS: Pediatric Cataract Management and Implications:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Timing of Surgery</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Critical for preventing amblyopia</strong>: The first few months of life are a period of rapid visual development. If the visual axis is obstructed by a cataract during this time, it can lead to <strong>permanent amblyopia</strong>, especially in unilateral cataracts.</li>\n<li><strong>Unilateral cataract</strong>: Surgery should ideally be performed between <strong>4 to 6 weeks</strong> of age.</li>\n<li><strong>Bilateral cataracts</strong>: If bilateral, surgery should be staggered, with the first eye typically operated on by <strong>4-6 weeks</strong> and the second eye within 1-2 weeks to reduce the risk of deprivation amblyopia.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Intraocular Lens (IOL) Consideration</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Infants under 6 months</strong>: IOL implantation in infants under 6 months of age is controversial due to risks like <strong>anterior capsular opacification</strong>, higher rates of <strong>postoperative complications</strong> (e.g., glaucoma), and <strong>ocular growth</strong> that can change the refractive status.</li>\n<li><strong>Older children</strong>: IOL implantation is typically performed in children older than 1 year after careful consideration. <strong>Aphakia</strong> correction with <strong>contact lenses</strong> or spectacles is used in younger infants until IOL implantation can be considered.</li>\n<li><strong>Choice of IOL</strong>: While important, the timing of surgery takes precedence in younger children. The use of a monofocal IOL is usually recommended, with the goal of allowing good distance vision.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>",
