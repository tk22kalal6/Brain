      "solution": "<ul>\r\n<li>Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is characterized by non-malignant T and B lymphoproliferation causing splenomegaly and enlarged lymph nodes;</li>\r\n<li>70% of patients also display autoimmune manifestations such as autoimmune cytopenias, Guillain-Barree syndrome, uveitis, and hepatitis.</li>\r\n<li><strong>A hallmark of ALPS is the presence of CD4-CD8- TCR&alpha;&beta;+ T cells (2-50%) in the blood of affected individuals.</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>The syndrome is caused by a defect in Fas-mediated apoptosis of lymphocytes</strong>, which can thus accumulate and mediate autoimmunity. Furthermore, ALPS can lead to malignancies.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Option B and C: Immunodeficiency syndromes (increased risk of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis )with partial albinism:</strong> Three conditions combine HLH and abnormal pigmentation, where hair examination can help in the diagnosis: Chediak-Higashi syndrome, Griscelli syndrome, and Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type II. <strong>Chediak-Higashi syndrome is also characterized by the presence of giant lysosomes within leukocytes.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Option D: IPEX syndrome-immune dysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy X-linked syndrome (IPEX), characterized by a widespread inflammatory enteropathy, food intolerance, skin rashes, autoimmune cytopenias, and diabetes. The syndrome is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the transcription factor <strong>FOXP3</strong>. In most cases of IPEX, CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells are absent from the blood.</p>\r\n ",
