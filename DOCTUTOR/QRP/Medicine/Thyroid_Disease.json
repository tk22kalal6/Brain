It is often used as a <strong>temporary measure, especially in older or unstable patients, to normalize thyroid function before definitive therapy</strong> (radioiodine or surgery). However, in this case, the definitive treatment option (radioiodine) is preferred.</p>\r\n<p>B) Perform fine-needle aspiration of the largest nodule: While FNA is important to rule out malignancy in thyroid nodules, it is not routinely indicated in all TMNG cases unless there are suspicious sonographic features (e.g., hypoechoic nodules with irregular borders). In this case, the patient's hyperthyroidism and typical scan findings (<strong>heterogeneous uptake</strong>) point to a diagnosis of toxic multinodular goiter, making FNA unnecessary at this stage.</p>\r\n<p>C) <strong>Administer radioactive iodine therapy: Radioactive iodine therapy is the treatment of choice for toxic multinodular goiter</strong>. It is effective in ablating the hyperfunctioning nodules while sparing normal thyroid tissue. This approach can control the hyperthyroidism and <strong>reduce the size of the goiter over time</strong>. It is a definitive, non-surgical treatment, especially suitable for older patients or those with comorbidities.</p><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3d535v34tlady.cloudfront.net/V3/NEETPGMCQ/20250109390734e2-7da9-4501-a5b7-1f65800cc044.jpg\"><p>D) Proceed with total thyroidectomy: Surgery (thyroidectomy) is a definitive treatment option, especially for patients with very large goiters causing compressive symptoms, suspicion of malignancy, or those unable to undergo radioactive iodine therapy.

Activating mutation of the TSH receptor</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mechanism</strong>: Activating mutations in the <strong>TSH receptor (TSH-R)</strong> can lead to <strong>autonomous thyroid function</strong>, causing hyperthyroidism. These mutations make the thyroid responsive without needing stimulation from <strong>TSH</strong>, leading to <strong>overproduction of thyroid hormones</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Associated Syndrome</strong>: <strong>Familial non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism</strong> is a well-recognized genetic syndrome resulting from activating <strong>TSH-R mutations</strong>. Patients typically present with <strong>goiter</strong>, <strong>hyperthyroidism</strong>, and <strong>thyroid nodules</strong> at an early age.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Option B. Activating mutation of Gs&alpha; (McCune-Albright syndrome)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mechanism</strong>: McCune-Albright syndrome is caused by post-zygotic mutations in the <strong>Gs&alpha;</strong> subunit, which leads to <strong>constitutive activation</strong> of adenylate cyclase. This overactivation can cause <strong>hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules</strong>, resulting in <strong>thyrotoxicosis</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Associated Syndrome</strong>: <strong>McCune-Albright syndrome</strong> is a genetic disorder characterized by a triad of features:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Caf&eacute;-au-lait spots</strong> (hyperpigmented macules on the skin)</li>\n<li><strong>Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia</strong> (bone lesions)</li>\n<li><strong>Endocrine hyperactivity</strong>, including <strong>hyperthyroidism</strong>, <strong>Cushing's syndrome</strong>, and <strong>precocious puberty</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Option C. Jod-Basedow phenomenon due to iodine excess</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mechanism</strong>: The <strong>Jod-Basedow phenomenon</strong> occurs when iodine intake increases suddenly (e.g., from iodine-containing contrast agents, medications like amiodarone, or dietary sources). In individuals with underlying <strong>thyroid autonomy</strong> (e.g., <strong>nodular goiter</strong>), the sudden availability of iodine leads to <strong>excessive production of thyroid hormones</strong>, causing <strong>thyrotoxicosis</strong>. However, this condition is <strong>acquired</strong> rather than genetic or congenital.</li>\n<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: <strong>Jod-Basedow phenomenon</strong> is an acquired form of hyperthyroidism and is <strong>not syndromic</strong>. It results from excess iodine intake in predisposed individuals and does not have a genetic or congenital basis.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Option D. Struma ovarii</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mechanism</strong>: <strong>Struma ovarii</strong> is a rare ovarian tumor that contains <strong>functioning thyroid tissue</strong>. The ectopic thyroid tissue in the tumor produces thyroid hormones, leading to <strong>thyrotoxicosis</strong>.

It is one of the most common causes of <strong>painful thyroiditis</strong> and is characterized by <strong>thyroid tenderness</strong> and <strong>thyrotoxicosis</strong> during the initial phase.</p>\r\n<p>Option <strong>A. Acute bacterial thyroiditis</strong>: <strong>Acute thyroiditis</strong> is typically due to a <strong>suppurative bacterial infection</strong> and is much <strong>rarer</strong> than subacute thyroiditis. It often presents with <strong>high fever</strong>, <strong>erythema over the thyroid</strong>, and <strong>systemic signs of infection</strong>. It is commonly caused by <strong>Staphylococcus</strong> or <strong>Streptococcus</strong>. Although <strong>thyroid pain</strong> is a shared feature, <strong>bacterial infections</strong> are associated with an <strong>elevated white blood cell count</strong> and <strong>fever</strong> and are usually more <strong>severe</strong> than viral-induced thyroiditis. The patient's symptoms and elevated <strong>ESR</strong> without clear infectious signs point to <strong>subacute thyroiditis</strong> instead of bacterial thyroiditis.</p>\r\n<p>Option <strong>B. Subacute (de Quervain's) thyroiditis: Correct answer</strong>: This patient's history of <strong>fever, neck pain,</strong> and <strong>thyroid tenderness</strong>, coupled with a <strong>preceding viral infection</strong> and <strong>elevated ESR</strong>, strongly points toward <strong>subacute thyroiditis</strong>. The disease often has a viral trigger and is characterized by a <strong>transient thyrotoxic phase</strong> (with <strong>suppressed TSH</strong> and elevated T4/T3) followed by a <strong>hypothyroid phase</strong>. Pain is a hallmark of this condition, distinguishing it from <strong>silent thyroiditis</strong>. The thyroid often recovers over a few months, but a minority of patients may develop permanent hypothyroidism.</p>\r\n<p>Option <strong>C. Hashimoto's thyroiditis: Hashimoto's thyroiditis</strong> is a <strong>chronic autoimmune disorder</strong> and typically presents with a <strong>painless, firm goiter</strong> or <strong>atrophic thyroid</strong> and is more associated with <strong>hypothyroidism</strong> over time. It is <strong>not typically associated with fever</strong> or <strong>thyroid pain</strong>, as seen in this patient. Additionally, <strong>Hashimoto's</strong> thyroiditis often presents with <strong>positive TPO antibodies</strong> and does not follow the acute, inflammatory course seen in subacute thyroiditis.</p>\r\n<p><strong>D. Silent thyroiditis: Silent thyroiditis</strong> (painless thyroiditis) is a form of <strong>autoimmune thyroiditis</strong> and is typically <strong>painless</strong>, unlike subacute thyroiditis, which is characterized by thyroid tenderness. It often occurs in the <strong>postpartum period</strong> or with the use of <strong>medications</strong> such as interferons or immune checkpoint inhibitors.

      "solution": "<p>Subacute thyroiditis is an <strong>inflammatory thyroid condition</strong> often triggered by a <strong>viral infection</strong> and typically follows a <strong>self-limited course</strong>. The patient usually presents in the <strong>thyrotoxic phase</strong>, during which <strong>thyroid hormone levels</strong> are elevated due to the release of preformed T4 and T3 from <strong>damaged thyroid follicles</strong>. The condition progresses through a <strong>thyrotoxic phase</strong>, a <strong>hypothyroid phase</strong>, and ultimately, recovery.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option A. Antithyroid drugs</strong>: Antithyroid drugs (e.g., methimazole, propylthiouracil) are used to reduce thyroid hormone production in patients with <strong>Graves' disease</strong> or <strong>toxic multinodular goiter</strong>, where thyroid hormone is overproduced due to gland hyperactivity. In <strong>subacute thyroiditis</strong>, the elevation in thyroid hormone is due to <strong>release</strong> of preformed hormone, not overproduction. Therefore, antithyroid drugs are <strong>ineffective</strong> in this setting.</p>\r\n<p>Option <strong>B. Radioactive iodine therapy: </strong>Radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy is used to <strong>destroy overactive thyroid tissue</strong> in cases of <strong>Graves' disease</strong> or <strong>toxic nodules</strong>. However, in <strong>subacute thyroiditis</strong>, the thyroid is <strong>not overactive</strong>; instead, it is <strong>inflamed</strong> and releasing preformed hormone. The <strong>low radioactive iodine uptake</strong> seen in this case confirms that the thyroid is not actively synthesizing hormone, making RAI therapy inappropriate.</p>\r\n<p><strong>C. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): NSAIDs</strong> (e.g., ibuprofen) are the treatment of choice for controlling <strong>pain</strong> and <strong>inflammation</strong> in <strong>subacute thyroiditis</strong>. These agents help reduce the <strong>thyroid pain</strong> and <strong>inflammation</strong> commonly seen in the early phase of the condition. <strong>Aspirin</strong> or <strong>corticosteroids</strong> (in more severe cases) are alternatives if NSAIDs fail to control symptoms. Since the thyroid gland inflammation is self-limited, symptom control with NSAIDs is often sufficient for many patients.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option D. Levothyroxine therapy</strong>: <strong>Levothyroxine</strong> (T4) therapy is indicated in the <strong>hypothyroid phase</strong> of subacute thyroiditis, if it occurs. In the initial <strong>thyrotoxic phase</strong>, the patient typically does not require thyroid hormone replacement. Treatment with <strong>levothyroxine</strong> is only started during the hypothyroid phase if the patient's T4 levels fall below normal and the hypothyroidism is <strong>symptomatic</strong> or prolonged.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Subacute thyroiditis</strong> presents with a <strong>painful thyroid</strong>, often following a <strong>viral infection</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>Treatment is focused on <strong>symptom control</strong>, primarily with <strong>NSAIDs</strong> or <strong>glucocorticoids</strong> in more severe cases.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Antithyroid drugs</strong> and <strong>radioactive iodine</strong> are ineffective in subacute thyroiditis, as the thyrotoxicosis results from <strong>release</strong> of preformed hormone, not <strong>overproduction</strong>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n ",
