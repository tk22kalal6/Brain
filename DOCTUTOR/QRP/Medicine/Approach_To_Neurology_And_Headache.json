      "solution": "<p>To systematically approach this case, follow the steps of neurologic localization:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Recognize the Clinical Features:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The patient has <strong>right-sided hemiparesis</strong>(weakness on one side of the body) and <strong>speech difficulty</strong> (specifically non-fluent speech, which indicates <strong>Broca&rsquo;s aphasia</strong>). Broca's aphasia is characterized by difficulty in producing speech while comprehension remains intact.</li>\r\n<li>The weakness is <strong>more pronounced in the arm than in the leg,</strong> suggesting that the lesion is more likely in a region of the brain where motor control for the arm is represented more strongly than for the leg (the <strong>motor cortex </strong>in the precentral gyrus).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Identify the Side of the Lesion:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Right-sided hemiparesis </strong>implies a <strong>left-sided lesion,</strong> as motor fibers cross in the medulla. Thus, we know the lesion is in the <strong>left hemisphere.</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Speech difficulties </strong>also localize to the left hemisphere in right-handed individuals and many left-handed individuals, as <strong>language is typically lateralized to the left hemisphere.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Assess the Type of Aphasia:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The patient has <strong>non-fluent speech with preserved comprehension,</strong> which is typical of <strong>Broca's aphasia.</strong> This further localizes the lesion to the <strong>left frontal lobe,</strong> specifically in <strong>Broca's area,</strong> which is responsible for speech production.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The presence of <strong>right hemiparesis, arm-predominant weakness,</strong> and <strong>Broca's aphasia</strong> makes the <strong>left frontal cortex</strong> (C), specifically in Broca's area, the most likely site of the lesion</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option A: Left internal capsule:</strong> A lesion here would typically cause pure motor symptoms (hemiparesis) without speech involvement, since the internal capsule carries motor fibers but is not directly involved in language production.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option B: Right cerebral cortex:</strong> A lesion here would cause left-sided motor deficits and would not affect speech, as language centers are usually on the left side.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option D: Brainstem:</strong> Lesions in the brainstem often cause <strong>crossed findings</strong> (e.g., ipsilateral cranial nerve deficits with contralateral body weakness). Additionally, brainstem lesions would not result in aphasia.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Right-sided weakness </strong>indicates a lesion in the <strong>left hemisphere</strong> due to the crossing of motor fibers.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Non-fluent aphasia (Broca's aphasia) </strong>suggests a lesion in the <strong>left frontal cortex,</strong> specifically in <strong>Broca's area.</strong></li>\r\n<li>Motor control for the arm is represented more superiorly and laterally in the motor cortex compared to the leg, explaining the <strong>arm-predominant weakness.</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Lesions in the internal capsule </strong>generally cause pure motor deficits without speech involvement, while <strong>brainstem lesions</strong> often result in crossed neurological findings.</li>\r\n</ul>",

      "solution": "<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Option B (10-12 L/min for 15-20 minutes) </strong>is <strong>Correct:</strong> The recommended treatment for <strong>acute cluster headache is high-flow oxygen therapy</strong> at <strong>10-12 L/min</strong> for <strong>15-20 minutes</strong> using a non-rebreather mask. This is highly effective in aborting cluster headache attacks, likely due to the vasoconstriction and modulation of pain pathways.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Option A (5 L/min for 10 minutes) </strong>is Incorrect: An oxygen flow rate of <strong>5 L/min </strong>is insufficient for treating cluster headaches. Higher flow rates are required to achieve therapeutic effects.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Option C (2 L/min for 30 minutes) </strong>is Incorrect: A flow rate of <strong>2 L/min</strong> is too low and the duration too long to be effective in managing acute cluster headaches.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Option D (20 L/min for 5 minutes) </strong>is Incorrect: While high-flow oxygen can be beneficial, <strong>20 L/min</strong> is excessive, and <strong>5 minutes</strong> is too short a duration for effective treatment. The recommended flow rate is <strong>10-12 L/min</strong> for a sustained period of <strong>15-20 minutes.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>High-flow oxygen therapy</strong>(10-12 L/min for 15-20 minutes) is an effective and recommended acute treatment for <strong>cluster headaches.</strong></li>\r\n<li>Oxygen therapy provides rapid relief for many patients with cluster headaches by reducing vasodilation and modulating pain pathways.</li>\r\n</ol>",
