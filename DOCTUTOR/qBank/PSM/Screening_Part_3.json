      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A higher</strong> <strong>prevalence</strong> of the disease in population A would result in fewer false positives among those who test positive, leading to a lower proportion of false positives compared to population B. T</li>\n<li>his is because the <strong>Positive Predictive Value</strong> (PPV) of a test, which is the proportion of true positives among all positive results, is directly proportional to the prevalence of the disease in the population.</li>\n<li>When the prevalence is higher, more of the positive test results are likely to be true positives, which in turn reduces the proportion of false positives.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Other Options</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Specificity of the test is lower in population A (Option A):</strong> If the specificity of the test were lower in population A, it would result in more false positives, not fewer, among those who test positive. Therefore, this option is unlikely.</p>\n<p><strong>Prevalence of disease is lower in population A (Option B):</strong> If the prevalence of the disease were lower in population A, it would lead to fewer true positives and thus a higher proportion of false positives among those who test positive. This would not explain why there are fewer false positives in population A compared to population B.</p>\n<p><strong>Specificity of the test is higher in population A (Option D):</strong> While higher specificity does lead to fewer false positives, this would not be the primary factor in explaining why there are fewer false positives in population A compared to population B, especially when comparing two populations with similar tests. The most likely explanation for a difference in the proportion of false positives among those who test positive is a difference in the prevalence of the disease between the two populations.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway</strong>:</p>\n<p>The <strong>prevalence</strong> of a disease in a population is directly related to the <strong>Positive Predictive Value</strong> (PPV) of a test. A higher prevalence increases the PPV, meaning a lower proportion of false positive results among those who test positive.</p>",

This scenario is a classic example of <strong>lead-time bias</strong>. Because the test detects the disease one year earlier, the survival time measured from diagnosis will appear to be one year longer, even though the person's actual lifespan has not changed.
