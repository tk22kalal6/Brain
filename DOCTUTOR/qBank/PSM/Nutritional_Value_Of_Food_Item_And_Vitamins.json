Instead, groundnut oil is more abundant in another type of omega-3 fatty acid called alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is less potent than EPA in providing health benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>Safflower oil (Option C):</strong> Safflower oil is primarily composed of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, particularly linoleic acid, which is an omega-6 fatty acid. While safflower oil is a healthy cooking oil choice, it does not contain significant amounts of EPA.</p>\n<p><strong>Sunflower oil (Option D):</strong> Sunflower oil is also primarily composed of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, with linoleic acid being the predominant omega-6 fatty acid.

Breast milk contains various B vitamins, including thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), pantothenic acid (B5), pyridoxine (B6), biotin (B7), and cobalamin (B12). While the levels of specific B vitamins in breast milk may vary, breast milk is generally not deficient in vitamin B as a group.</p>\n<p><strong>Pantothenic acid (Option D):</strong> Pantothenic acid, also known as vitamin B5, is important for energy metabolism and synthesizing hormones and cholesterol. Breast milk contains pantothenic acid, although the exact levels may vary. Breast milk is not typically deficient in pantothenic acid.</p>",
