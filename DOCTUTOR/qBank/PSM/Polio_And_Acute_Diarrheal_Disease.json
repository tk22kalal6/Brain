Although acute infections can occur, it is less common and are often asymptomatic or present with mild symptoms. Additionally, Hepatitis C is typically transmitted through exposure to infected blood rather than through the ingestion of contaminated food or water.</p>\n<p><strong>Hepatitis D (Option D):</strong> Hepatitis D virus (HDV) is a defective virus that requires co-infection with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) for replication.

While most individuals clear the virus during the acute phase, a subset develops chronic hepatitis B, defined by persistence of HBsAg beyond six months. Chronic infection increases the risk of progressive liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.</p>\n<p><strong>Hepatitis C (Option C): </strong>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a leading cause of chronic liver disease. Unlike Hepatitis A, acute HCV infection progresses to chronicity in 75-85% of cases. Chronic HCV infection significantly increases the risk of cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma.</p>\n<p><strong>Hepatitis D (Option D):</strong> Hepatitis D infection can occur as either a co-infection with HBV or as a superinfection in individuals already infected with HBV. Hepatitis D infection can progress to chronicity, especially in individuals with chronic Hepatitis B infection.</p>",

Immunisation serves as an important complementary measure that reduces disease incidence and severity but does not offer complete protection. Combining both approaches is essential for effective typhoid prevention.</p>\n<p><strong>Drug resistance in typhoid is less significant compared to tuberculosis (Option C): </strong>Drug-resistant strains of Salmonella Typhi have become an increasing public health concern, particularly in endemic regions. The rise of multidrug-resistant strains complicates the treatment of typhoid fever and undermines control efforts, especially in areas with limited access to effective antibiotics.</p>\n<p><strong>Person-to-person transmission occurs in 10% of cases (Option D):</strong> Typhoid fever mainly spreads via faecal-oral or urine-oral routes. Thus, transmission typically occurs indirectly through ingestion of food or water contaminated by faeces or urine of infected individuals or carriers.
