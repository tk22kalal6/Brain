This includes search and rescue operations, medical assistance, provision of food, water, shelter, and other humanitarian aid.</p>\n<p><strong>Rehabilitation:</strong> Once the immediate response phase is completed, the focus shifts to rehabilitation.

In triage, they are usually tagged black and given the lowest priority so resources can be used for patients who have better survival chances.</p>\n<p><strong>Follow first-come, first treat patients (Option B): </strong>Triage does not follow arrival time; it is not a queue system. Instead, patients are treated based on the <strong>severity of their condition</strong>, regardless of when they arrived.</p>\n<p><strong>Green colour indicates the highest priority (Option C): </strong>In triage systems, green is assigned to ambulatory or \"walking wounded\" patients. They have minor injuries, are hemodynamically stable, and can wait for treatment. Red is the colour for the highest priority, typically for those who are critically ill but have a good chance of survival with immediate care.</p>",
