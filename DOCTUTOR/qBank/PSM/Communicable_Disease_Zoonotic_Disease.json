This means the next generation of vectors is born already infected.</li>\n<li>An example of transovarial transmission is <strong>Rickettsia rickettsii in ticks</strong>, the causative agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Cyclo-propagative - Plasmodium in mosquitoes (Option B):</strong> In cyclo-propagative transmission, the infectious agent undergoes changes in form as well as multiplication within the vector. In the case of malaria, Plasmodium parasites enter the mosquito during a blood meal, undergo sexual reproduction and sporogony, producing numerous sporozoites.</p>\n<p><strong>Cyclo-developmental - Wuchereria bancrofti in mosquitoes (Option C):</strong> In cyclo-developmental transmission, the pathogen undergoes development but no multiplication within the vector. Wuchereria bancrofti, which causes filariasis, follows this pattern. After a mosquito ingests microfilariae from an infected host, they develop into infective larvae without multiplying and are then transmitted to another person during a subsequent bite.</p>\n<p><strong>Propagative - Yersinia pestis in rat fleas (Option D): </strong>The transmission of Yersinia pestis, the plague bacilli by rat fleas is an example of propagative biological transmission, where the pathogen multiplies within the vector but does not undergo any developmental changes. In this case, the bacteria proliferate in the flea's gut and are transmitted to humans during subsequent bites.</p>\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGUPDATEDMCQ/20250925d4fee4f9-b991-4056-8408-c09decfac15f.PNG\">",

Humans can become infected with Ebola through contact with infected animals or through human-to-human transmission, but they are considered dead-end hosts because sustained human-to-human transmission is not typical. Ebola outbreaks often start with zoonotic transmission from animals to humans, and human outbreaks usually do not result in sustained transmission beyond a limited number of generations of cases.</p>",

It can cause severe respiratory illness and encephalitis, with a mortality rate ranging from <strong>40% to 70%</strong>, depending on the outbreak and the quality of healthcare in affected regions.</p>\n<p><strong>Ebola (Option D):</strong> Ebola virus disease is a severe and often deadly illness in humans. The average Ebola disease case fatality rate is around 50%. The case fatality rates during outbreaks have varied widely, ranging from around 25% to over 90%.
