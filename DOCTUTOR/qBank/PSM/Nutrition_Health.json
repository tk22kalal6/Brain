Severe pantothenic acid deficiency is rare and can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, irritability, numbness, and muscle cramps, but burning sole syndrome is not a well-documented symptom of this deficiency.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, while burning sole syndrome is not specifically associated with a deficiency of pantothenic acid, the other options listed do not align with the symptoms typically observed in burning sole syndrome.
