Such a low ratio may not be efficient or cost-effective in terms of healthcare resource allocation.</p>\n<p><strong>20000 population </strong><strong>(Option B ruled out)</strong>: While this ratio would be an improvement over Option A, it is still lower than the recommended standard of one health assistant for every 30,000 population.
