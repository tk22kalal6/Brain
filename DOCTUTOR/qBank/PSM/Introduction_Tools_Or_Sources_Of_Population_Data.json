      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>The correct answer is <strong>Social mobility</strong>, which refers to the movement of individuals or groups within a social hierarchy, typically marked by changes in socio-economic indicators like income, occupation, education, and social status.</p>\n<p><strong>Key features of Social Mobility:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Involves <strong>upward, downward, or horizontal</strong> movement in social hierarchy.</li>\n<li>It can occur across <strong>generations (intergenerational)</strong> or <strong>within a person's lifetime (intragenerational)</strong>.</li>\n<li>Indicates <strong>dynamic changes</strong> in the socio-economic landscape of a society.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Social equality (Option A):</strong> Refers to <strong>equal rights and opportunities</strong> for all individuals, regardless of their social or economic background. It is an ideal state, whereas social mobility is a measurable process of movement.</p>\n<p><strong>Socio-economic upliftment (Option C):</strong> Describes <strong>broad interventions</strong> to improve economic and social conditions (e.g., poverty reduction programs). It is an outcome, not the process of movement.</p>\n<p><strong>Social mobilisation (Option D):</strong> Involves <strong>collective action</strong> and engagement of communities for social or political causes. It may support policies enabling mobility, but it is conceptually distinct.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\n<p>Social mobility specifically denotes the movement across different socio-economic levels, making it the most appropriate answer among the given choices.</p>",
