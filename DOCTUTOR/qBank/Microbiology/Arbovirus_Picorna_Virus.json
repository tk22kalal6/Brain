      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Antigenic type 3</strong> is responsible for vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis.</li>\n<li><strong>Poliomyelitis</strong> is an acute infectious disease that can affect the central nervous system in severe cases, leading to the destruction of motor neurons in the spinal cord and resulting in flaccid paralysis, though most infections are subclinical.</li>\n<li>There are <strong>three antigenic </strong>types based on VP1, VP2, and VP3 epitopes. Of the three wild poliovirus types, types 2 and 3 have been eradicated worldwide, while type 1 remains in circulation in <strong>Afghanistan </strong>and <strong>Pakistan</strong>, with recent years also seeing outbreaks of circulating <strong>type 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus</strong>.</li>\n<li>The virus <strong>enters via the mouth</strong>, multiplying initially in the oropharynx or intestine, and is present in the throat and stool before symptoms appear. Excretion in <strong>stools </strong>continues for weeks despite antibodies in the blood.</li>\n<li>Most poliovirus infections are <strong>asymptomatic</strong> or inapparent. Following an incubation period of 3-6 days, about 5% of individuals develop a mild illness (abortive poliomyelitis) with symptoms such as fever, malaise, sore throat, anorexia, muscle aches, and headache, which typically resolve within 3 days.</li>\n<li>Around 1% of cases present with <strong>aseptic meningitis</strong> (nonparalytic poliomyelitis), where cerebrospinal fluid examination shows lymphocytic pleocytosis, normal glucose levels, and normal or slightly elevated protein levels.</li>\n<li>The poliovirus mainly targets<strong> motor neurons</strong> located in the <strong>anterior horn of the spinal cord </strong>and the cranial nerve nuclei within the medulla oblongata.</li>\n<li>Muscle infection does not occur and damage in muscles is secondary to nerve cell destruction, with some recovery possible. Other pathology includes myocarditis, lymphatic hyperplasia, and Peyer's patch ulceration.</li>\n<li>Clinically, infection can be inapparent, mild, or severe, with an incubation period of 7-14 days (range 3-35 days). Mild disease presents with low-grade fever, malaise, and nonspecific symptoms, resolving in days.</li>\n<li><strong>Nonparalytic poliomyelitis</strong> presents with stiffness and back or neck pain, usually resolving without paralysis. <strong>Paralytic poliomyelitis </strong>causes <strong>flaccid paralysis </strong>from lower motor neuron damage, with variable recovery. Progressive postpoliomyelitis muscle atrophy may occur decades later.</li>\n<li>Laboratory diagnosis involves virus isolation from throat, rectal, or<strong> stool specimens</strong>. Cultures are inoculated into human or monkey cells, with cytopathic effects seen in 3-6 days. PCR may be used. Rising antibody titers confirm infection.</li>\n<li>Immunity is permanent for the infecting type, mainly antibody-mediated, though heterotypic resistance is limited. Passive immunity is <strong>maternally transferred</strong> and wanes within months. Antibody formation occurs soon after exposure, often before symptoms.</li>\n<li>Prevention uses <strong>inactivated (Salk) </strong>and <strong>live attenuated (Sabin)</strong> The inactivated vaccine induces <strong>humoral immunity</strong> but not intestinal immunity, while the live vaccine induces both <strong>systemic</strong> and <strong>mucosal immunity</strong>. The latter results in excretion of virus in the feces and results in<strong> herd immunity</strong>.</li>\n<li>Live vaccines can revert to virulence, though rarely. Live vaccines should not be given to immunodeficient individuals.</li>\n<li>Oral polio vaccine (OPV) is generally safe, but rare adverse events can occur, the most significant being <strong>vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP)</strong>.</li>\n<li>It can occur in both OPV recipients and their unvaccinated contacts, most often linked to Sabin 3, followed by Sabin 2 and Sabin 1.<strong> (Options A, B, and D ruled out)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs)</strong> are biologically similar to Wild polio viruses but differ from most vaccine-related poliovirus (VRPV) strains by possessing genetic traits that enable prolonged replication or transmission, lasting much longer than the typical 4-6 weeks in OPV recipients.</li>\n</ul>",

Replication is confined to the nasal mucosa epithelium, producing <strong>edema and mild inflammation</strong>. The incubation period is 2-4 days, with illness lasting about a week, often with a lingering cough.</li>\n<li>Adults usually have one or two colds per year, with symptoms such as sneezing, nasal congestion, discharge, sore throat, mild cough, malaise, and chills, but little or no fever. <strong>Secondary bacterial infections</strong> may lead to otitis media, sinusitis, bronchitis, or pneumonia.</li>\n<li>Neutralizing antibodies develop in most people 7-21 days after infection, appearing in serum and nasal secretions, but immunity is incomplete and titers decline over time. The infection occurs worldwide, peaking in early fall and late spring, and is lowest in summer.</li>\n<li>It spreads mainly through<strong> contact with contaminated respiratory secretions</strong>, often via hands and contaminated objects, with survival on surfaces for hours.</li>\n<li>Infants and young children are most affected, and transmission within families is common.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Influenza virus (Option A): </strong>Influenza mainly targets the <strong>upper respiratory tract</strong> and is particularly dangerous for older adults, young children, and people with chronic health conditions.

In more severe instances, especially among high-risk groups, it can progress to<strong> pneumonia</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Adenovirus (Option C): </strong>Adenoviruses commonly cause mild, <strong>self-limiting respiratory illnesses in children</strong>, occasionally affecting the eye and gastrointestinal tract, with serotypes 1-7 being most frequent. They can lead to conditions such as pneumonia, <strong>pharyngoconjunctival fever</strong>, <strong>epidemic keratoconjunctivitis</strong>, and gastroenteritis, while immunocompromised patients may develop severe or disseminated disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Measles virus (Option D): </strong>Measles in nonimmune individuals begins after an incubation of 8-15 days with a <strong>prodrome</strong> of fever, cough, <strong>coryza</strong>, conjunctivitis with photophobia, and <strong>Koplik spots</strong> followed by a characteristic rash starting on the face and spreading to the trunk and limbs.
