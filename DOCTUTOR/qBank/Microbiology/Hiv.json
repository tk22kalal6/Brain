      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Blood transfusion has the maximum risk of transmission.</li>\r\n<li>HIV is mainly spread through sexual contact, blood exposure, and mother-to-child transmission.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Sexual transmission</strong> is the<strong> most common</strong> route globally, with heterosexual transmission dominating in developing countries and male-to-male transmission in many developed regions.</li>\r\n<li>However, the efficiency of heterosexual transmission is generally low, especially in the absence of genital ulcers and high viral loads.</li>\r\n<li>Seminal and vaginal fluids contain HIV, and the risk increases with conditions like <strong>genital inflammation</strong> and ulcerative STIs.</li>\r\n<li>Receptive<strong> anal intercourse</strong> carries the highest sexual transmission risk due to the thin and fragile nature of rectal mucosa and the <strong>potential for trauma</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>Several cofactors influence transmission, including <strong>viral load</strong>, which is the primary determinant of infectivity. High plasma HIV RNA levels increase the likelihood of transmission, while effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces it significantly.</li>\r\n<li>When HIV is undetectable in the blood due to ART, the risk of sexual transmission becomes virtually zero: a concept widely known as \"U=U\" (Undetectable = Untransmittable).</li>\r\n<li><strong>Male circumcision</strong> also reduces HIV acquisition, particularly in heterosexual men, likely due to decreased exposure of target immune cells in the foreskin and reduced risk of ulcerative STIs.</li>\r\n<li>Injection drug use presents a substantial risk, especially with shared needles or paraphernalia, as does <strong>transfusion of infected blood</strong>, which carries the highest per-act risk. <strong>(Options A, C, and D ruled out)</strong></li>\r\n<li>However, modern screening has nearly eliminated transfusion-related transmission in countries with advanced healthcare systems.</li>\r\n<li>Occupational exposure, particularly among healthcare workers who sustain needlestick injuries or mucosal contact with infected fluids, has a small but documented risk. The use of postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) in these cases significantly lowers this risk.</li>\r\n<li>Mother-to-child transmission can occur during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. The risk is closely linked to <strong>maternal viral load</strong> and ART during pregnancy and avoidance of breastfeeding where alternatives are safe can reduce this risk substantially.</li>\r\n</ul>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The HIV virion exhibits an <strong>icosahedral shape</strong> with many external surface spikes. These spikes are composed of the <strong>envelope proteins gp120</strong> and <strong>gp41</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>The envelope exists as a trimeric heterodimer, and the virus buds from the host cell surface, incorporating host proteins into its lipid bilayer during this process.</li>\r\n<li>Although retroviruses possess a positive-sense RNA genome, they lack the machinery to replicate this RNA directly in the cytoplasm.</li>\r\n<li>Instead, each virion contains two copies of the RNA genome, two transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, and an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase known as <strong>reverse transcriptase</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>The tRNA acts as a primer for generating a circular complementary DNA (cDNA) copy of the viral RNA. This cDNA is <strong>produced in the cytoplasm</strong> and then <strong>transported to the nucleus</strong>, where it becomes integrated into the host cell's chromatin.</li>\r\n<li>Once integrated, the viral genome behaves like a cellular gene. Promoters located at both ends of the inserted viral DNA enhance its transcription by the host cell, producing full-length RNA transcripts that serve as new viral genomes.</li>\r\n<li>Additionally, alternative splicing of these transcripts gives rise to various individual mRNAs.</li>\r\n<li>The replication process begins when the viral <strong>gp120 </strong>protein binds with high specificity to <strong>CD4 receptor</strong>s, mainly on <strong>T-helper lymphocytes</strong>. This binding triggers a conformational change, enabling interaction with one of the two co-receptors, CCR5 or CXCR4, which facilitates<strong> viral entry</strong> into the host cell.</li>\r\n<li>The viral <strong>gp41</strong> protein aids in <strong>fusion</strong> with the host membrane, allowing the viral core to enter the cytoplasm. Uncoating follows, forming the preintegration complex containing viral RNA, enzymes, and accessory proteins.</li>\r\n<li>Reverse transcription occurs, converting viral RNA to DNA.

Initial testing includes a <strong>fourth-generation HIV antigen/antibody ELISA</strong>, hepatitis B and C screening (unless the individual is already immune to hepatitis B through vaccination), serum creatinine, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT).</li>\r\n<li>For sexual exposures, tests for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis should also be performed. After completing the PEP course, follow-up testing is advised at 4-6 weeks and 3 months post-exposure, with an additional HIV test at 6 months if hepatitis C infection occurred, as HIV seroconversion may be delayed in co-infection.</li>\r\n<li>PEP involves a <strong>three-drug regimen taken for 28 days</strong>. In those aged 12 years or older, the preferred regimen is tenofovir DF plus emtricitabine, combined with either dolutegravir (once-daily) or raltegravir.</li>\r\n</ul>",
