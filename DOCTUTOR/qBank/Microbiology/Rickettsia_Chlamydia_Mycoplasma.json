It commonly develops 1-4 weeks after a genital infection, with <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> being a common trigger organism, particularly in genetically predisposed individuals (most of whom possess the HLA-B27 haplotype).</li>\n<li>The knee, ankle, small joints of feet, and sacroiliac joints are commonly affected, and it is the most common cause of peripheral inflammatory arthritis in young men. Resolution typically occurs without specific treatment, but relapses are common.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Disseminated gonococcal infection; <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> (Option B):</strong> While <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> can cause arthritis and urethritis, it usually presents as <strong>septic arthritis</strong>, which is purulent, rather than the reactive form of arthritis seen in Reiter's syndrome.

However, this patient's symptoms (urethritis, conjunctivitis, and arthritis) fit more closely with <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> as the trigger, especially given the history of urethral discharge, making <em>Salmonella</em> a less likely primary cause in this specific scenario.</p>\n<p><strong>Rheumatic fever, <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em> (Option D):</strong> <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em> typically causes atypical pneumonia, and rheumatic fever is a post-streptococcal inflammatory disease. Neither of these aligns with the triad of symptoms (urethritis, conjunctivitis, and arthritis) characteristic of Reiter's syndrome. <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em> does not typically cause arthritis associated with urethritis and conjunctivitis.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>The triad of <strong>urethritis, conjunctivitis, and arthritis</strong> (Reiter's syndrome) in a young male, particularly following genitourinary symptoms, is highly suggestive of <strong>Reactive arthritis</strong> triggered by infections like <strong>Chlamydia trachomatis</strong>.</p>",

This is because <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> is an <strong>obligate intracellular bacterium</strong>, meaning it requires living cells to replicate and cannot be easily cultured in standard laboratory media. Furthermore, while <em>Chlamydia</em> is a gram-negative bacterium, its cell wall structure is atypical, which makes it difficult to visualize using the standard Gram staining technique.</p>\n<p><strong>Blood culture (Option C):</strong> Blood culture is <strong>not a viable method</strong> for diagnosing <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>.

Its clinical course progresses through three stages:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>First stage:</strong> A <strong>painless ulcer</strong> develops on the penis or vulva after an incubation period of 3 days to 6 weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Second stage:</strong> Inguinal lymph nodes in the groin become <strong>enlarged, tender, and soft (called bubo)</strong>. These buboes may break down and discharge externally as chronic fistulae. A <strong>groove sign</strong> (unilateral) may be present due to enlargement of nodes above and below the inguinal ligament. Systemic symptoms like fever, headache, and myalgia may also develop.</li>\n<li><strong>Third stage:</strong> Occurs in untreated cases, especially in women and homosexual men, leading to rectal stricture, rectovaginal and rectal fistulae, and <strong>esthiomene</strong> (edematous granulomatous hypertrophy of the vulva, scrotum, or penis). Elephantiasis of the vulva or scrotum may occur due to impaired lymphatic drainage and is endemic in tropical regions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Donovanosis (Option A):</strong> Caused by <em>Klebsiella granulomatis</em>, this presents with initially single or multiple firm papules progressing to a granulomatous ulcer. The ulcer is typically slowly progressive, <strong>painless, beefy red in color, and bleeds on touch</strong>. Subcutaneous extensions can form pseudobuboes. While painless, the appearance and progression differ from the characteristic buboes and fistulae of LGV.</p>\n<p><strong>Chancroid (Option C):</strong> Caused by <em>Haemophilus ducreyi</em>, Chancroid presents with a <strong>soft chancre</strong>. These ulcers are typically multiple, necrotic, non-indurated, <strong>tender</strong>, and bleed on touch. The tenderness of the ulcer and lack of characteristic bubo progression distinguish it from LGV.</p>\n<p><strong>Herpes genitalis (Option D):</strong> Caused by HSV-2, this initially forms vesicles that rupture to form multiple, grouped, <strong>tender ulcers</strong> (polycyclic margins) along with bilateral painful enlarged inguinal lymph nodes. The tenderness and vesicular nature of the lesions differentiate it from the painless ulcer and specific bubo formation of LGV.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>The presence of a <strong>painless genital ulcer</strong> followed by <strong>enlarged, tender, suppurating inguinal lymph nodes (buboes) with cutaneous microabscesses (\"watering can sign\") and potentially a \"groove sign\"</strong>, indicates <strong>Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV)</strong>, caused by specific serovars of <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>.\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height: auto; display: block; vertical-align: middle; border: 0;\" src=\"https://d3d535v34tlady.cloudfront.net/V3/NEETPGMCQ/202501315bc15e6c-6eb0-4fa5-9109-847de8f4d19f.jpg\">\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height: auto; display: block; vertical-align: middle; border: 0;\" src=\"https://d3d535v34tlady.cloudfront.net/V3/NEETPGMCQ/202501314db262e3-da9d-47ae-b81d-5f9f37d7508a.jpg\">",
