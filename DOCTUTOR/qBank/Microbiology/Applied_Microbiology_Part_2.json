This hybridoma cell has two unique properties:\n<ul>\n<li>Produces monoclonal antibodies of the same antigen specificity (due to B cell component)</li>\n<li>Multiplies indefinitely, producing clones of identical cells (due to the immortal myeloma cell component).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Steps of the hybridoma technique</strong><strong></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mouse splenic B cells: The mouse is injected with an antigen containing the desired epitope. After an interval, the mouse splenic B cells are obtained, which are activated against the epitope of the antigen injected.</li>\n<li><strong>Myeloma cells are used as a source of immortal cells.</strong>They are cancerous plasma cells. They closely resemble mouse B cells; hence are compatible for fusion.</li>\n<li>HAT medium is used here. It contains hypoxanthine, aminopterin and thymidine.</li>\n<li>Purine synthesis in mammalian cells (e.g. splenic B cells) occurs by either de novo or salvage pathways.</li>\n<li>Aminopterin blocks the de novo pathway so that the cell has to perform the salvage pathway to synthesise purines for its survival <em>(Option C ruled out).</em></li>\n<li>Salvage pathway requires two important enzymes- HGPRT (hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase) and thymidine kinase. So any cell (e.g. myeloma cell) that lacks HGPRT cannot grow on HAT medium.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Fate of three types of cells on HAT media:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unfused splenic B cells: They can grow, but do not survive long, as they are not immortal</li>\n<li>Unfused myeloma cells: They cannot grow as they lack the HGPRT enzyme to perform the salvage pathway of purine synthesis</li>\n<li>Hybridoma cells: They can grow and survive long time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Types of Monoclonal Antibodies</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mouse mAb: It contains 100% mouse-derived proteins.</li>\n<li>Chimeric mAb: It is prepared by recombination of 34% mouse proteins (variable region) and 66% human proteins (constant region) <em>(Option D ruled out).</em></li>\n<li>Humanised mAb: Here, only the antigen-binding site (i.e. CDR-complementarity-determining region) is mouse-derived (10%) and the remaining part of the mAb is human-derived.</li>\n<li>Human mAb: It contains 100% human-derived amino acids.

If the target antigen (in this case, the SARS-CoV-2 antigen) is present, it binds to the antibodies and forms a visible line (such as a coloured band) at a specific spot on the test strip, indicating a positive result.<strong> </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Flow through assay (Option B)</strong>: Similar to LFA, but the fluid passes through the entire membrane and is captured at a specific site. It is not commonly used for COVID-19 antigen tests. </p>\n<p><strong>Chemiluminescence Linked Immunoassay (CLIA) (Option C): </strong>Involves a chemiluminescent reaction to detect the presence of an antigen or antibody. While CLIA is used in some COVID-19 testing platforms, it is not the principle behind most rapid antigen tests. </p>\n<p><strong>ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) (Option D):</strong> This test involves a more complex and time-consuming process that detects either antigens or antibodies.

The clinical history with the finding of Nagler's test positive suggests <strong>Gas gangrene</strong>, caused by <strong>Clostridium perfringens,</strong> for which Nagler's test is used to detect the presence of <strong>Alpha toxin</strong> activity.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Alpha toxin</strong>is a <strong>phospholipase</strong> that breaks down cell membranes, leading to <strong>tissue necrosis, inflammation</strong>, and the production of <strong>gas</strong> (which causes crepitus).</li>\n<li>This is the key toxin responsible for the clinical features of <strong>gas gangrene..</strong><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGUPDATEDMCQ/20250910-8e2d4c7a-3f91-41db-9f3a-52ce1d8b9a2e.png\"></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Epsilon toxin (Option A): </strong>Epsilon toxin is a potent neurotoxin that can cause damage to the blood<strong>-</strong>brain barrier and affect vascular permeability. It disrupts the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, leading to oedema in the brain and <strong>neurological damage.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Iota toxin (Option B):</strong> Iota toxin is responsible for <strong>necrotising enteritis.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Beta toxin (Option C)</strong>: Beta toxin is an anenterotoxin produced by C. perfringens, which causes <strong>necrotising enteritis</strong>, also known as <strong>pig-bel</strong>.</p>",
