These proteins include structural components and enzymes necessary for replication.</li>\n<li><strong>DNA viruses</strong> often <strong>use host nuclear enzymes</strong>, while <strong>RNA viruses</strong> may carry their own polymerases, especially in the case of negative-strand RNA viruses.</li>\n<li>Some viruses also produce microRNAs and regulate gene expression via splicing or polyprotein processing.</li>\n<li>The next stage, <strong>morphogenesis and release</strong>, involves assembly of new viral particles. <strong>Nonenveloped viruses</strong> typically accumulate inside the host cell until lysis, while enveloped viruses acquire their lipid envelope by <strong>budding</strong> through host membranes.

This<strong> capsid</strong> may be further encased by an envelope made up of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates. The proteins, often <strong>glycoproteins</strong>, that form part of the capsid or envelope (such as HIV gp120) are key to determining how a virus interacts with its host. The capsid serves to safeguard the viral nucleic acid.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Viroid (Option B): </strong>Certain infectious plant diseases are attributed to viroids, which are small, <strong>single-stranded RNA molecules</strong> that form covalently closed circular structures with extensive internal base pairing, giving them a rod-like shape. In their extracellular form, viroids consist solely of RNA without any capsid. These RNA molecules do not encode proteins and rely entirely on the<strong> host cell's machinery </strong>for replication.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Bacteriophage (Option D): </strong>Bacteriophages are viruses that infect<strong> prokaryotic cells</strong> and when it integrates its DNA into a bacterial genome or plasmid, it is termed a prophage.Their nucleic acids which encased in a protein shell can vary and may consist of dsDNA, dsRNA, ssRNA, or ssDNA, sometimes containing modified bases like hydroxymethylcytosine. Many phages possess <strong>tail structures</strong> that help them attach to bacterial receptors and inject their genetic material into host cells.</p>",

For more reliable detection, it is better to test for HDAg or HDV RNA in the blood, or look for IgM antibodies specific to HDV.</li>\n<li>During recovery from coinfection, these markers including HDV RNA and even anti-HDV antibodies typically disappear within months or years.</li>\n<li>In contrast, superinfection with HDV leads to<strong> chronic HDV infection</strong> in over 70% of cases, with sustained high levels of both IgM and IgG antibodies against HDV, as well as continued detection of HDV RNA and HDAg.</li>\n<li>Superinfections are more likely to cause severe liver damage, including fulminant hepatitis.</li>\n<li>Other types of viral interactions include recombination, phenotypic mixing, and interference.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Recombination (Option B): </strong>Recombination is a process where viral progeny <strong>acquire genetic traits</strong> not simultaneously present in either parent virus. It typically involves breaking of nucleic acid strands and f<strong>using portions of genomes</strong> from two parental viruses, producing a recombinant virus that is genetically stable and replicates consistently.</p>\n<p><strong>Interference (Option C): </strong>Interference refers to the<strong> inhibition</strong> of replication of one virus when two viruses infect the same cell or host simultaneously. This phenomenon is independent of specific immunity and does not occur with all virus combinations. Interference can happen through various mechanisms. One virus may block or <strong>destroy the cellular receptors</strong> needed by the other virus, as seen with retroviruses or orthomyxoviruses. Another mechanism is that the two viruses might c<strong>ompete for replication machinery</strong> like polymerases or initiation factors, or the first virus may stimulate the cell to produce <strong>inhibitory substances </strong>such as interferons that block the replication of the second virus.</p>\n<p><strong>Viral vector (Option D):&nbsp; </strong>Recombinant DNA technology has enabled <strong>viral genomes</strong> to be used as tools for expressing both viral and cellular genes, making it possible to produce biological substances like hormones, vaccines, and interferons. This technology utilizes both DNA viruses and RNA viruses each offering unique benefits and limitations.</p>",

This phenomenon is observed when cells are infected with <strong>high doses</strong> of certain viruses, such as influenza, resulting in high hemagglutinin titers but low infectivity. This scenario is termed the von Magnus phenomenon.</li>\n<li>In some cells, viral infection does not yield infectious particles due to a cellular block in replication and this is called an <strong>abortive infection</strong>, where the failure lies in the cell type rather than in the virus. <strong>(Option C ruled out)</strong></li>\n<li>Additionally, some viruses are <strong>genetically defective</strong>, meaning they cannot independently produce complete progeny. Their replication depends on the simultaneous presence of a helper virus that can supply the missing genetic functions.</li>\n<li>For example, certain strains of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) lack genes for the viral envelope and require a<strong> helper virus</strong> such as avian leukosis virus to form infectious progeny. The envelope proteins of such progeny are determined by the helper virus. Other examples include <strong>hepatitis D virus</strong>, which relies on hepatitis B, and <strong>adeno-associated satellite viruses</strong>, which depend on adenoviruses.</li>\n<li>These genetically deficient viruses that require helper activity to produce infectious particles are termed <strong>defective viruses</strong>. <strong>(Option D ruled out)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Pseudovirions</strong> are a unique kind of defective viral particle that package host cell DNA instead of the virus&rsquo;s own genetic material. During replication, the viral capsid may mistakenly encapsulate fragments of <strong>host nucleic acid</strong> rather than viral nucleic acid. Although these structures resemble typical virus particles under electron microscopy, they are incapable of replication. However, they may have the potential to transfer host cell genetic material between cells.<strong> (Option B ruled out)</strong></li>\n</ul>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>OPV vaccine can prevent an outbreak of wild polio strains by the phenomenon of <strong>viral interference</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Interference</strong> refers to the phenomenon where infection of a cell by one virus hampers the concurrent or subsequent infection by another virus.</li>\n<li>This effect, often mediated by <strong>interferon</strong>, is distinct from immune responses and does not occur with every virus combination, as some viruses can still replicate efficiently within the same host cell.</li>\n<li>Interference may arise through various mechanisms. One virus can block or <strong>destroy cell receptors</strong>, preventing the second virus from attaching. Examples include retroviruses and enteroviruses blocking, and orthomyxoviruses destroying receptors.</li>\n<li>Another mechanism involves one virus outcompeting the other for<strong> replication machinery l</strong>ike polymerases or initiation factors.</li>\n<li>Additionally, one virus may <strong>stimulate the production</strong> of substances like <strong>interferon</strong> in the infected cell, which inhibits the replication of other viruses.</li>\n<li>Different types of interference have been described. One such form, &lsquo;<strong>autointerference</strong>,&rsquo; occurs when a high viral load inhibits production of infectious progeny.</li>\n<li>Interference has practical applications, such as the <strong>use of live attenuated poliovirus </strong>vaccine to block wild poliovirus. However, pre-existing enteric viruses can also interfere with vaccine virus replication, potentially compromising its efficacy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Examples of other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Genetic recombination(Option A): </strong>&nbsp;Recombination leads to the creation of a new progeny virus, known as a <strong>recombinant</strong>, that possesses characteristics not simultaneously present in either parent virus. This process typically involves the<strong> breaking of nucleic acid strands</strong> and the joining of genetic segments from two different parent genomes. The resulting recombinant virus is genetically stable and continues to produce similar progeny upon replication.</p>\n<p><strong>Complementation (Option B): </strong>Complementation describes the interaction between gene products of two viruses <strong>co-infecting</strong> a cell, where one or both viruses may have <strong>genetic defects</strong>. This interaction enables replication of one or both viruses in conditions where they normally could not replicate. The process occurs when one virus supplies a <strong>functional gene product</strong> that <strong>compensates</strong> for a defect in the other virus, thereby supporting its replication. Importantly, the genetic material of both viruses remains unchanged.</p>",
