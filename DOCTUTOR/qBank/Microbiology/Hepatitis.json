Another category involves mutations in the core promoter region, which suppress transcription of the HBeAg coding region. These mutations produce a phenotype with <strong>detectable HBV DNA</strong> but <strong>absence of HBeAg</strong>, despite the presence of anti-HBe antibodies. Such patients tend to have more severe or advanced liver disease and are often identified later in the disease course.</p>\n<p><strong>Escape mutation (Option C): </strong>Escape mutants of HBV involve a mutation at position 145 of the <strong>HBsAg</strong>, replacing glycine with arginine. This structural alteration <strong>impairs antibody recognition</strong>, leading to loss of neutralizing activity by anti-HBs. These mutants have been found in individuals who developed HBV infection<strong> despite prior immunization</strong> or passive immunotherapy, such as liver transplant recipients treated with monoclonal anti-HBs.

Transmission within households and institutions is common, with a <strong>seasonal tendency</strong> to occur in autumn.</li>\n<li>Hepatitis A typically has an <strong>abrupt onset</strong>, often with fever above 38&deg;C.

HAV particles can be visualized in stool using immune electron microscopy. The virus is detectable in stool, liver, bile, and blood using PCR or immunoassays, starting around 2 weeks before and up to 2 weeks after the onset of jaundice.</li>\n<li>Serological testing reveals that<strong> IgM anti-HAV</strong> peaks around two weeks after enzyme elevation and becomes undetectable within 3-6 months, while IgG anti-HAV appears soon after symptom onset and persists for life.</li>\n</ul>",

While hepatitis A generally does not significantly affect pregnancy outcomes in low-resource settings, both maternal and perinatal mortality are notably higher.

As the disease progresses, fibrosis develops from portal and periportal regions, advancing to bridging fibrosis and ultimately cirrhosis. Distinctive features include \"<strong>ground-glass</strong>\" hepatocytes in <strong>hepatitis B</strong> due to HBsAg accumulation.</p>\n<p><strong>Necrosis with neutrophilic infiltrate and Mallory bodies (Option C): Chronic hepatitis C </strong>commonly displays noticeable clusters of lymphoid cells or well-developed lymphoid follicles within the portal tracts.</p>",
