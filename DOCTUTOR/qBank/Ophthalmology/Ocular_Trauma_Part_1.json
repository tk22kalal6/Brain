      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\r\n<p>The best way to distinguish a restrictive ophthalmoplegia from a paretic motility disorder after a blow-out fracture is forced duction testing.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Ophthalmoplegia can be caused by a variety of conditions, including space-occupying lesions within the orbit, inflammatory or restrictive muscle disorders such as thyroid eye disease or orbital myositis, and mechanical entrapment of the extraocular muscles following orbital wall fractures. Additionally, involvement of the cranial nerves that control eye movement may occur due to lesions located in the posterior orbit, superior orbital fissure, or cavernous sinus. Examples of such conditions include carotid-avernous fistula, Tolosa-unt syndrome, and malignant tumours of the lacrimal gland.</li>\r\n<li>To distinguish between a restrictive cause and a neurogenic cause of ophthalmoplegia, several clinical tests may be used. The forced duction test, performed under topical anaesthesia, involves gently manipulating the globe in the direction of limited movement. If resistance is felt, it suggests a mechanical restriction, whereas smooth passive movement points to a neurological cause.</li>\r\n<li>Another useful method is the differential intraocular pressure (IOP) test, in which a difference in pressure of 6 mmHg or more when measured in primary gaze and when the patient attempts to look in the restricted direction supports the presence of a mechanical restriction, a finding known as the Braley sign. Assessment of saccadic eye movements can also be useful to distinguish between restrictive and paretic causes.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong><strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Alternate prism cover testing (Option A):</strong> The alternate prism cover test helps to measure the degree of deviation in strabismus, but cannot be used to differentiate between restrictive and neurological causes.<strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Goldmann perimeter (Option B): </strong>The Goldmann perimeter can be used to assess the field of binocular single vision and is used in the assessment of strabismus.<strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Motility examination of the cardinal positions of gaze (Option C): </strong>There are nine diagnostic positions of gaze in which ocular deviations are measured. This includes the six cardinal positions, the primary position, elevation and depression.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong><strong></strong></p>\r\n<p>The image shows a <strong>D-shaped pupil, which </strong>is a characteristic finding in<strong> iridodialysis.</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Iridodialysis refers to the dehiscence of the iris from the ciliary body at its root and is commonly associated with blunt trauma to the eye. This is in contrast to cyclodialysis, which is the circular separation of the peripheral iris and ciliary body from the sclera at the scleral spur. Both may need surgical intervention if large or if associated with hypotony.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong><strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Lens dislocation (Option A):</strong> Blunt trauma can result in zonular disruption and dislocation of the lens, which can result in secondary glaucoma. It is also associated with <strong>Marfan's syndrome</strong> and <strong>homocystinuria</strong>. It does not cause a D-shaped pupil.</p>\r\n<p><strong>High intraocular pressure (Option C)</strong>, such as in acute angle-closure glaucoma, typically causes a mid-dilated fixed pupil, not the flat-edge deformation seen in iridodialysis.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Iridocyclitis (Option D)</strong>, or anterior uveitis, leads to irregular, small pupils due to posterior synechiae and inflammation.</p>",
