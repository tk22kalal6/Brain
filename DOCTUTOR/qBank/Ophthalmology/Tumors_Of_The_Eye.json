It typically affects middle-aged women and is the second most common primary optic nerve tumor after glioma. These tumors are slow-growing and may compress the optic nerve, leading to progressive visual impairment.</li>\n<li>Clinically, patients usually present with <strong>unilateral, painless visual loss,</strong> often accompanied by an afferent pupillary defect. Visual acuity decline is <strong>gradual</strong>. Axial proptosis may occur due to the mass effect within the orbit, and optic disc appearance may initially be normal-especially if the tumor is retrobulbar-but may later show optic atrophy or optociliary shunt vessels.</li>\n<li>Imaging (MRI with contrast) is key for diagnosis, typically revealing a <strong>\"tram-track\" </strong>sign representing enhancement of the meningioma along the optic nerve sheath.<br><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGUPDATEDMCQ/20250908471b87ae-162f-4c73-90be-25ae9708518e.png\"></li>\n<li>Treatment is usually observation in stable cases, but radiotherapy is the mainstay if vision worsens. <strong>Surgical excision</strong> is avoided unless vision is already lost, due to the high risk of optic nerve damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Incorrect Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the lacrimal gland (Option A):</strong></p>\n<p>This tumor typically presents with <strong>painful</strong>, <strong>rapidly progressive</strong> proptosis due to perineural invasion. It often causes <strong>superotemporal orbital fullness</strong> and is associated with <strong>bony destruction</strong> on imaging. The absence of pain and the chronic, indolent nature of symptoms in this patient make this diagnosis unlikely.</p>\n<p><strong>Orbital lymphoma (Option B):</strong></p>\n<p>Orbital lymphoma usually presents in <strong>older adults</strong> and typically causes <strong>painless proptosis</strong> or orbital swelling, often without early vision loss. When it affects vision, it is due to <strong>mass effect</strong>, but <strong>optic nerve dysfunction</strong>(RAPD) is less common in the early stages. Imaging shows a <strong>well-defined homogenous mass</strong>, often molding to adjacent structures, rather than a lesion centered around the optic nerve.</p>\n<p><strong>Optic nerve glioma (Option C):</strong></p>\n<p>Optic nerve glioma is more commonly seen in <strong>children</strong>, particularly in association with <strong>neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)</strong>. It typically presents before the age of 10. In adults, optic gliomas are rare and tend to be more aggressive. Also, gliomas tend to cause <strong>more pronounced optic disc changes</strong> (e.g., swelling or atrophy) and often show <strong>fusiform enlargement</strong> of the optic nerve on imaging, which may not align with the subtle signs in this case.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>The <strong>most common distant site of metastasis</strong> in <strong>malignant melanoma of the eye</strong>, particularly <strong>uveal (choroidal) melanoma</strong>, is the <strong>liver</strong>.</p>\n<p>Uveal melanoma, the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults, spreads <strong>hematogenously</strong> rather than through lymphatics, since the <strong>uvea lacks lymphatic vessels</strong>. Among distant organs, the <strong>liver is the most commonly involved</strong>, with <strong>up to 90%</strong> of metastatic cases showing liver involvement. This strong hepatic tropism is a distinctive feature of uveal melanoma, unlike cutaneous melanoma, which may spread widely to lymph nodes, lungs, brain, and other organs.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Incorrect Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Brain (Option A):</strong></p>\n<p>While brain metastases are common in <strong>cutaneous melanoma</strong>, they are relatively <strong>less frequent in uveal melanoma</strong>, especially as the initial site of metastasis.</p>\n<p><strong>Lung (Option B):</strong></p>\n<p>Lung metastasis may occur in systemic spread, but <strong>not as commonly as the liver</strong> in uveal melanoma.</p>\n<p><strong>Lymph node (Option D):</strong></p>\n<p>Uveal melanoma does <strong>not spread via lymphatics</strong> due to the absence of lymphatic channels in the eye. Therefore, lymph node involvement is rare.</p>",
