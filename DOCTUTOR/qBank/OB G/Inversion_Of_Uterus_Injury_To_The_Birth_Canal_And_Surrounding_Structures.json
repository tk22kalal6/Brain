      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Uterine inversion</strong> is a rare but life-threatening obstetric emergency where the uterus turns inside out, usually following delivery. It is most commonly associated with <strong>excessive traction on the umbilical cord</strong> or <strong>fundal pressure</strong> when the uterus is atonic. Certain <strong>placental factors</strong> can predispose to inversion due to abnormal adherence or location of the placenta.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Incorrect options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Placenta previa (Option A):</strong></p>\n<p>In this condition, the placenta is located near or covering the cervical os. It can cause <strong>antepartum hemorrhage</strong>, but it is <strong>not typically associated</strong> with uterine inversion, as the placenta is low-lying and does not exert traction on the uterine fundus.</p>\n<p><strong>Placental abruption (Option B):</strong></p>\n<p>This refers to <strong>premature separation</strong> of a normally implanted placenta. It can cause concealed or revealed bleeding but does <strong>not lead to uterine inversion</strong> because the placenta separates prematurely and usually does not remain adherent to cause fundal traction.</p>\n<p><strong>Placenta accreta (Option C):</strong></p>\n<p>This is a condition where the placenta is <strong>abnormally adherent to the myometrium</strong> and fails to separate properly after delivery. If <strong>excessive cord traction</strong> is applied in an attempt to deliver such a placenta, it can lead to <strong>pulling the uterine fundus inward</strong>, causing <strong>uterine inversion</strong>. This is the most relevant placental factor associated with inversion.</p>",

A <strong>supralevator hematoma</strong> occurs <strong>above the pelvic diaphragm</strong> and is usually due to <strong>injury to uterine or vaginal artery branches</strong>, especially during traumatic or instrumental deliveries. These hematomas may not be externally visible but can present with <strong>pelvic pain, hemodynamic instability</strong>, or a <strong>mass felt on bimanual examination</strong>.</p>\n<p>A <strong>supralevator hematoma</strong> is a <strong>deep pelvic hematoma</strong> and must be suspected in postpartum women with <strong>persistent pain, hypotension, or pelvic mass</strong> despite a contracted uterus and no visible bleeding. It often requires <strong>imaging and surgical or radiologic intervention</strong> for management.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Incorrect Options: </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Vulvar hematoma (Option A):</strong></p>\n<p>Occurs <strong>superficially</strong>, involving the labia or perineum. It is typically <strong>visible externally</strong> as a swelling or discoloration of the vulva. The image in question would not show a deep pelvic collection if this were the case.</p>\n<p><strong>Infralevator hematoma (Option C):</strong></p>\n<p>Occurs <strong>below the levator ani</strong> muscles, often in the <strong>ischiorectal fossa</strong> or perineal region. It may present with <strong>painful perineal swelling</strong> but remains inferior to the pelvic diaphragm, unlike the image shown.</p>\n<p><strong>Cervical hematoma (Option D):</strong></p>\n<p>Would appear as a <strong>localized hematoma near the cervix</strong> or within the cervical canal. These are usually <strong>small and localized</strong>, and do not extend into the deep pelvic spaces.</p>",
