      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Section 30 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS)</strong> provides a legal basis for performing an act in good faith for the benefit of a person, even without their consent, under specific critical circumstances. This section is applicable when it is impossible for the person to signify consent or if they are incapable of giving consent, and there is no guardian or authorized person available in time to obtain consent for a beneficial act. The scenario described&mdash;an unconscious adult patient requiring urgent, life-saving neurosurgical intervention with no available guardian-perfectly aligns with the provisions of this section.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Section 30 BNS</strong> covers situations where consent cannot be obtained due to the person's inability to signify it (e.g., altered sensorium, unconsciousness) or incapacity, and there is no guardian available in time.</li>\n<li>The act must be done <strong>in good faith</strong> and for the <strong>benefit of the person</strong>. In this case, urgent neurosurgery for hydrocephalus is a beneficial and life-saving procedure.</li>\n<li>This section provides legal protection to medical professionals acting in an emergency when obtaining traditional informed consent is impossible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Section 25 (Option A):</strong> This section deals with <strong>\"Act not intended and not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, done by consent.\" </strong>This section requires consent from a person above eighteen years of age and applies when harm is caused by an act that was <em>not intended</em> or <em>not known to be likely to cause</em> death or grievous hurt. It is not applicable here because the patient is unconscious and cannot provide consent, and neurosurgical intervention inherently carries risks, including grievous hurt or death, which would be known to the surgeon.</p>\n<p><strong>Section 27 (Option B):</strong> This section refers to <strong>\"Act done in good faith for benefit of child or person of unsound mind, by, or by consent of guardian.\"</strong> This section specifically addresses acts done for persons under twelve years of age or persons of unsound mind, requiring the consent of a guardian. It is not applicable to a 19-year-old adult patient (who is not necessarily of unsound mind in a persistent sense) where no guardian is available.</p>\n<p><strong>Section 28 (Option C):</strong> This section explains what kind of \"<strong>Consent known to be given under fear or misconception\" </strong>or by a person of <strong>\"unsoundness of mind, or intoxication\" </strong>or <strong>\"under twelve years of age\"</strong> is <em>not</em> considered valid consent. This section defines invalid consent and does not provide a basis for performing an act without consent in an emergency; rather, it highlights situations where purported consent would be legally null.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>In medical emergencies where an adult patient is in an <strong>altered sensorium/incapable of consent</strong>, and no guardian is immediately available, <strong>Section 30 of the BNS</strong> protects medical professionals who act <strong>in good faith for the patient's benefit</strong> to prevent harm.</p>",

This deals with involuntary intoxication, not mental illness.</p>\n<p><strong>Sec. 24 BNS (Option D):</strong> This section deals with \"Offence requiring a particular intent or knowledge committed by one who is intoxicated.\" It clarifies that if an act requires a particular intent or knowledge to be an offense, a person doing it in a state of intoxication (unless the intoxication was involuntary) is liable as if they had that knowledge. This section specifically concerns voluntary intoxication and its impact on criminal intent, not mental illness.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>The <strong>criminal responsibility of a mentally ill person</strong> under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) is specifically addressed by <strong>Section 22 BNS</strong>, which provides an exception for acts done by a person of unsound mind incapable of understanding the nature or wrongfulness of their actions.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>The scenario describes a woman's suicide within seven years of marriage, with evidence of dowry-related harassment, which falls under multiple sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS). The husband and/or relatives can be punished under <strong>Sections 80 BNS (Dowry death), 85 BNS (Cruelty by husband or relatives), and potentially 306 BNS (Abetment of suicide)</strong>, though 306 BNS is not listed as an option here. Section 108 BNS likely refers to Abetment in general, which would cover abetment to suicide if the number mapping is different. Since the options given are 1, 2, and 4, it implies 1, 2, and the concept of abetment (which 4 might represent, given the options and exclusion of 3).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Section 80 BNS (Dowry death):</strong> The definition of \"dowry death\" in Section 80(1) BNS applies as the death occurred within seven years of marriage, and there is evidence of cruelty or harassment by the husband or relatives in connection with a dowry demand. This section explicitly states that such a husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused her death.</li>\n<li><strong>Section 85 BNS (Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty):</strong> Section 85 BNS directly addresses the act of a husband or his relative subjecting a woman to cruelty, which is the \"dowry harassment\" mentioned in the question.</li>\n<li><strong>Abetment of Suicide (Implied by context for option 4, potentially 306 BNS in a different numbering system):</strong>Although Section 306 BNS (Abetment of suicide) is not given as a numbered option within the question's list (1, 2, 3, 4), the general concept of abetment applies. If the harassment was such that it drove the woman to commit suicide, then the perpetrators could also be held liable for abetment of suicide. Given that \"108 BNS\" is option 4, and 108 BNS typically deals with abetment (as per IPC; assuming a similar structure in BNS or a typo/remapping in the question), the husband and relatives could be punished for abetting the suicide. Since the woman herself committed suicide, the husband and/or relatives cannot be charged with murder under Section 103 BNS.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>In a case of a woman committing suicide within seven years of marriage due to dowry harassment, the husband and/or relatives can be held liable for <strong>Dowry death (Section 80 BNS)</strong>, <strong>Cruelty (Section 85 BNS)</strong>, and potentially <strong>Abetment of suicide (implied by option 4, corresponding to Section 306 BNS in a typical criminal code structure)</strong>. Murder charges (Section 103 BNS) are not applicable as the woman committed suicide.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Section 200 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS)</strong> specifically deals with the <strong>punishment for non-treatment of victims by hospitals</strong>. It states that whoever, being in charge of a hospital (public or private), contravenes the provisions of Section 397 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS), shall be punished. Section 397 BNSS, in turn, mandates free treatment for victims of rape and acid attack and requires informing the police about such incidents.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This section ensures that hospitals provide immediate and free medical treatment to victims of certain offenses.</li>\n<li>Non-compliance with these provisions by hospital authorities is an offense punishable with imprisonment for up to one year, or a fine, or both.</li>\n<li>This provision aims to safeguard the rights of victims, particularly those of rape and acid attack, by ensuring they receive timely medical attention.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Disclosure of identity of victim of rape (Option B):</strong> This is dealt with under <strong>Section 72(1) of BNS</strong>, which prescribes punishment for the disclosure of a rape victim's identity.</p>\n<p><strong>Exposure and abandonment of a child under twelve years of age (Option C):</strong> This offense is covered by <strong>Section 93 BNS</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Concealment of birth by secret disposal of dead body (Option D):</strong> This offense is addressed by <strong>Section 94 BNS</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Section 200 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS)</strong> makes <strong>non-treatment of victims by hospitals</strong> a punishable offense, linking it to the mandate for free treatment of victims of certain crimes under Section 397 of the BNSS.</p>",

While a board of medical experts is involved in the certification, the responsibility for the definitive diagnosis of brainstem death is placed on the neurosciences specialist.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Board of Medical Experts:</strong> The Act mandates that brainstem death must be certified by a board of medical experts.

While \"may extend to 10 years\" means 2 to 5 years is <em>possible</em> within the range, the option \"More than 5 years\" is more accurate because of the high maximums and the 5-year minimum for commercial dealings. The intent of the question is to identify the range that covers the most severe penalties.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>Under the <strong>Transplantation of Human Organs Act 1994</strong>, a doctor found guilty of illegal organ removal or commercial dealings faces <strong>imprisonment for a term that can extend to 10 years</strong>, and for commercial dealings, it is <strong>not less than 5 years</strong>.
