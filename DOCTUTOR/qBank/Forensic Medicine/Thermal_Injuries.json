While the patient has hypothyroidism and hypothermia, the specific act of being found <em>in a wardrobe</em> strongly points to the behavioral aspect of terminal burrowing, which is a direct consequence of severe hypothermia itself, rather than solely attributing the finding to myxoedema coma without further clinical context. Myxoedema coma <em>causes</em> hypothermia, but burrowing is a specific behavioral manifestation <em>of</em> severe hypothermia.</p>\n<p><strong>Paradoxical undressing (Option C):</strong> Paradoxical undressing is a phenomenon where victims of severe hypothermia remove their clothes due to a sudden, erroneous feeling of warmth. While it is often associated with terminal burrowing, the primary finding described in the question is being found <em>in a wardrobe</em> (seeking an enclosed space), which directly aligns with terminal burrowing behavior, not necessarily the act of undressing.</p>\n<p><strong>Sudden cardiac arrest (Option D):</strong> Sudden cardiac arrest is a common cause of death in severe hypothermia due to the heart's vulnerability to cold.

Singeing of external hair (like eyebrows and facial hair) can occur simply by exposure to <strong>dry flame</strong> and does not necessarily indicate that the hot gases or smoke were <em>inhaled</em> into the respiratory tract. It indicates proximity to a flame, but not direct inhalation injury.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Hoarseness &amp; stridor of voice (Option A):</strong> This is a strong proof of inhalational burns. Hot air can injure the laryngeal mucosa, leading to hoarseness and stridor, indicating damage to the upper airway.<br /> <strong>Blackish soot deposited on the posterior aspect of tongue (Option C):</strong> Soot deposition in the air passage, including on the posterior aspect of the tongue and other mucous membranes, is a direct indicator of smoke inhalation due to flying ashes.</p>\n<p><strong>Yellow colored sputum (Option D):</strong> Yellow colored sputum (or yellow frothy sputum) is a sign of inhalational burns.

Crucially, these false splits show no bleeding in the deeper tissues, which is consistent with the victim's presentation. Therefore, this finding does not indicate homicide.</p>\n<p><strong>Bleeding in the epidural space (Option B):</strong> A heat hematoma, which is a mass of blood resembling a true extradural hematoma, can form between the skull and the dura in burn victims.

Heat fractures of the skull take approximately 20 minutes of heat application before the skull begins to crack.</p>\n<p><strong>It does not involve the suture lines (Option D):</strong> This statement is true. Heat fractures usually do not involve the sutures of the skull, even in young individuals with un-united sutures.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation of Answer:</strong></p>\n<p>The false statement regarding electrical injury is <strong>Direct current is more damaging than alternating current</strong>. This is incorrect because <strong>alternating current (AC) is definitively more damaging than direct current (DC)</strong>. AC is four to six times more likely to cause death, partly due to the \"let-go\" or \"hold-on\" effect, which is a tetanoid muscle spasm that prevents the victim from releasing the live conductor. Additionally, AC is far more prone to inducing cardiac arrhythmias than DC.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The most common cause of death is ventricular fibrillation ending in cardiac arrest(Option A):</strong> This statement is true. The most frequent fatal process in electric shock is a cardiac dysrhythmia, typically ventricular fibrillation, which ultimately leads to asystole and cardiac arrest.</p>\n<p><strong>The most dangerous contact path is entry through the right hand and exit through the feet(Option B):</strong> This statement is true, according to some claims. This particular current path is believed to cause the maximum percentage (up to 8.5%) of the total body current to flow through the heart. Other paths, such as head to feet, left hand to feet, hand to hand, or foot to foot, result in less current flow through the heart. (Note: One reference indicates the left arm to the opposite leg as the most dangerous path to affect the heart.)</p>\n<p><strong>With repeated exposure, tolerance develops to electric shock(Option C):</strong> This statement is true. It is commonly believed that individuals can gain a degree of tolerance to electric shock, and professional electricians are sometimes observed to work on live 240 V conductors without apparent harm.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>A crucial aspect of electrical injury is that <strong>alternating current (AC) poses a significantly greater danger and causes more damage than direct current (DC)</strong>, largely due to its propensity to induce muscle spasm and cardiac arrhythmias.</p>",

These are generally considered \"endogenous burns,\" meaning they result from heat generated within the body rather than from external heat application.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Linear burns (Option A):</strong> These are seen in moist creases and folds of the skin, varying from 3-30 cm in length and 0.3-2.5 cm in width. They are an endogenous burn specific to lightning injury.</p>\n<p><strong>Punctate burns (Option B):</strong> These are multiple circular burns, ranging from a few millimeters to 1 cm in size. They are also a type of endogenous burn associated with lightning.</p>\n<p><strong>Filigree burns (Option C):</strong> Also known as Lichtenberg flower, arborescent marks, feathering, ferning, or chronographic burns, these are characteristic fern-like patterns on the skin.
