      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>\n<p>Ultrasound machines operate based on the principle of <strong>piezoelectric crystal excitation</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An ultrasound (sonographic/echographic) image is formed by the <strong>mechanical oscillations of piezoelectric crystals that</strong> are excited by electrical pulses. This phenomenon is known as the <strong>piezoelectric effect</strong>.</li>\n<li>The tip of an ultrasound transducer is made up of these <strong>piezoelectric crystals</strong>, such as <strong>lead zirconate titanate</strong>.</li>\n<li>When an electric current passes through the transducer, these crystals vibrate, producing <strong>ultrasound waves</strong>.</li>\n<li>These waves propagate through different tissues and are then <strong>reflected back</strong>. The transducer crystals then convert these reflected waves back into <strong>electrical impulses</strong>.</li>\n<li>These impulses are further processed to form an ultrasound image on the screen, utilizing the <strong>pulse-echo principle</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Very low frequency radiowaves (Option B):</strong> Very low frequency radiowaves or <strong>radiowaves in general are used in MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans</strong>, not in ultrasound.</p>\n<p><strong>Microwaves (Option C):</strong> Microwaves are a type of electromagnetic radiation used in various applications (e.g., microwave ovens, radar) but are <strong>not the primary principle behind diagnostic ultrasound imaging</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Linear attenuation of X-rays (Option D):</strong> The linear attenuation of X-rays describes how X-ray beams lose intensity as they pass through matter, which is the <strong>fundamental principle of X-ray imaging and CT scans</strong>, not ultrasound.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>Ultrasound imaging fundamentally relies on the <strong>piezoelectric effect</strong>, where special crystals in the transducer convert electrical energy into sound waves and vice versa, using the <strong>pulse-echo principle</strong> to generate images.</p>",

This occurs when there is <strong>no difference in acoustic density</strong> within the structure, allowing sound waves to pass through unimpeded.</li>\n<li><strong>Homogeneous fluids</strong>, like those typically found in a simple cyst, <strong>transmit sound exceptionally well</strong>. Because the sound passes through without reflection, the area appears black on the ultrasound image.</li>\n<li>Furthermore, these fluids cause <strong>increased echoes in structures deeper to them</strong> (posterior enhancement) due to minimal attenuation of the sound beam.</li>\n</ul>\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGUPDATEDMCQ/20250722466a5ef7-922f-486b-8e00-b93242299235.png\">\n<p><strong>Explanation of Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Air (Option A):</strong> Air is <strong>hyperechoic</strong> (bright) and causes <strong>dirty shadowing</strong> on ultrasound because it reflects and scatters almost all the sound waves, preventing sound from passing deeper.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CBD (Common Bile Duct) stones at the distal end of the CBD</strong> are challenging to visualize using ultrasonography.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ultrasonography may not effectively visualize these stones due to <strong>poor imaging quality caused by overlying bowel gas</strong> or a <strong>limited acoustic window</strong> in that specific anatomical region.
