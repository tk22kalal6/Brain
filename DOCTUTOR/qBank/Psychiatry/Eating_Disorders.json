While antidepressants are often helpful, <strong>bupropion should be avoided</strong> in this case.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Bupropion is a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI).</li>\r\n<li>It is contraindicated in patients with eating disorders, especially bulimia nervosa.</li>\r\n<li>It lowers the seizure threshold, and individuals with bulimia are already at increased risk of seizures, particularly due to electrolyte disturbances from vomiting and purging.</li>\r\n<li>Additionally, it has anorectic (appetite-suppressing) properties, which may worsen disordered eating behaviors.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Fluoxetine (Option A):</strong> First-line SSRI approved for the treatment of bulimia nervosa. It helps reduce binge-purge cycles and improve mood.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Trazodone (Option B):</strong> An antidepressant with strong sedative properties; sometimes used for <strong>insomnia</strong> in depressed patients. It does not lower the seizure threshold significantly.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Amitriptyline (Option D):</strong> A tricyclic antidepressant (TCA); though not first-line due to anticholinergic side effects and overdose risk, it's not contraindicated like bupropion.</p>",
