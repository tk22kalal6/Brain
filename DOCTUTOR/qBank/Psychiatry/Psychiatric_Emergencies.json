Examples include superficial cutting, burning, or hitting oneself.</li>\n<li><strong>Parasuicide (Option B)</strong> is a term used for self-injurious behaviour that resembles suicide attempts but typically lacks a true intent to die. This includes behaviours such as superficial cutting or overdose, often carried out in the context of emotional turmoil.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Aborted Suicide Attempt (Option C):</strong> This term refers to a situation where a person plans and prepares for suicide, but stops themselves before carrying it out.

Low levels of 5-HIAA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been consistently associated with increased risk of suicidal behaviour, especially in individuals with mood disorders or impulsive traits.</li>\n<li>TPH (Tryptophan Hydroxylase) is the rate-limiting enzyme in serotonin biosynthesis. A polymorphism in the TPH gene has been identified, with two alleles: U and L.</li>\n<li>The TPH*L allele is associated with reduced enzymatic activity, leading to lower serotonin synthesis, which contributes to lower central serotonin turnover.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation for answer:</strong></p>\n<p>Crisis intervention is a short-term, immediate psychological support provided to individuals experiencing an acute psychological crisis such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sudden death of a loved one</li>\n<li>Accidents or natural disasters</li>\n<li>Interpersonal violence or trauma</li>\n<li>Psychiatric emergencies (e.g., suicidal ideation, psychosis)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Its main goals are to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stabilize the individual</li>\n<li>Reduce acute distress</li>\n<li>Restore functioning</li>\n<li>Prevent long-term psychological harm</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It involves active listening, emotional support, validation, practical assistance, and linking to longer-term care if needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Clinical Significance:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Used in emergency psychiatry, community health, and disaster response</li>\n<li>Helps prevent suicide, decompensation, PTSD, or worsening of psychiatric symptoms</li>\n<li>Important for first responders, clinicians, and crisis helplines</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>SAFER-R Model (Crisis Intervention Framework):</strong></p>\n<p>SAFER-R is a structured model of crisis intervention used widely in clinical and emergency settings:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>S</strong> &ndash; Stabilize the situation</li>\n<li><strong>A</strong> &ndash; Acknowledge the crisis</li>\n<li><strong>F</strong> &ndash; Facilitate understanding</li>\n<li><strong>E</strong> &ndash; Encourage adaptive coping</li>\n<li><strong>R</strong> &ndash; Restore functioning</li>\n<li><strong>R</strong> &ndash; Refer to additional resources if needed</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This model ensures empathy, structure, and swift action during mental health crises.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Triage technique in crisis (Option A): </strong>Triage refers to assessing the severity and urgency of patients' conditions (commonly in emergency settings). While triage may be part of a broader crisis response, it is not synonymous with crisis intervention.</p>\n<p><strong>Counselling techniques immediately following suicide (Option C): </strong>Postvention (not crisis intervention) refers to the support offered after a suicide to prevent contagion and support the grieving. Crisis intervention is broader and not limited to post-suicide scenarios.</p>\n<p><strong>Reference</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559081/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559081/</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
