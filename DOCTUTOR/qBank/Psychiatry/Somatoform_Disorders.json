It explains traits like orderliness, stubbornness, or stinginess, not sudden motor/sensory symptoms.</p>\n<p><strong>Deliberate production of symptoms for external gain (Option C) </strong>is seen in malingering, where the individual consciously produces symptoms for external rewards (e.g., financial compensation, avoiding work).</p>\n<p><strong>Structural abnormalities in the corticospinal tract of the dominant hemisphere (Option D)</strong> would cause organic motor deficits like weakness or paralysis, and would be evident on imaging and neurological exams.

While it may theoretically inhibit dopamine pathways and raise prolactin, galactorrhoea is rare. It more commonly causes sexual side effects like decreased libido or anorgasmia.</p>\n<p><strong>Clonazepam (Option</strong> <strong>C): </strong>Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine that works by enhancing GABAergic transmission. It has no action on dopamine pathways and therefore does not cause hyperprolactinemia. It is not associated with galactorrhoea or menstrual disturbances.</p>\n<p><strong>Sertraline (Option D): </strong>Sertraline, another SSRI, may rarely elevate prolactin levels through serotonergic mechanisms. However, clinically significant hyperprolactinemia with galactorrhoea or amenorrhoea is uncommon. Like other SSRIs, it is more often associated with sexual dysfunction than endocrine side effects.</p>",
