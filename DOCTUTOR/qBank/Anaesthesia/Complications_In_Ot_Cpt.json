Turning off the anesthesia machine and disconnecting the breathing circuit helps eliminate the oxidizing environment. <strong>(Option B ruled out)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Remove the Endotracheal Tube (ETT):</strong> The ETT-especially if made of PVC-is highly flammable and acts as a fuel source. Its immediate removal is essential to prevent further thermal damage to the tracheobronchial tree and stop the progression of the fire within the airway. <strong>(Option A ruled out)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Extinguish the Fire by Irrigating with Saline or Sterile Water: </strong>After tube removal, pour cold saline into the airway to douse any remaining flames and cool the tissue. This step also helps minimize mucosal injury and prevent ongoing combustion of any residual material. <strong>(Option D ruled out)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Re-establish and Secure the Airway</strong>: Once the fire is extinguished, assess and secure the airway. Depending on the situation, this may involve:\n<ul>\n<li>Mask ventilation with room air</li>\n<li>Insertion of a new endotracheal tube</li>\n<li>Emergency tracheostomy if airway edema or obstruction is severe<br />Avoid using high oxygen concentrations during this stage unless absolutely necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Perform Fiberoptic Endoscopy (After Stabilization):</strong> After the patient is stabilized, a fiber-optic bronchoscopy should be performed to:\n<ul>\n<li>Evaluate the extent of thermal injury</li>\n<li>Detect any residual fragments of the burnt tube or debris</li>\n<li>Guide further airway management or referral to specialists</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is not part of acute fire suppression, but an essential post-event evaluation</p>",
