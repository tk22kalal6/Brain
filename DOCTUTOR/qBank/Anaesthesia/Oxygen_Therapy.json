Venturi masks operate on the Venturi effect, which is a consequence of the Bernoulli principle.

Each colour-coded Venturi device is engineered to deliver a specific FiO<sub>2</sub> by entraining a fixed ratio of ambient air to oxygen.

CNS Oxygen Toxicity</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Seen in hyperbaric conditions, not typically at 1 atm</li>\r\n<li>Symptoms include: nausea, dizziness, seizures, tremors</li>\r\n<li>Called the Paul Bert effect</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>4. Retrolental Fibroplasia (ROP)</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Only occurs in preterm neonates</li>\r\n<li>Risk factor: PaO<sub>2</sub> &gt; 100 mm Hg</li>\r\n<li>Not a concern in adults receiving oxygen therapy</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>5. Oxygen Therapy Guidelines</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Avoid FiO<sub>2</sub> &gt; 60% for &gt; 24-48 hours unless clinically indicated</li>\r\n<li>Target SpO<sub>2</sub>:</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>88-92% in COPD patients</li>\r\n<li>94-98% in others</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n  <li>Monitor for signs of toxicity if high FiO<sub>2</sub> is unavoidable</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>6. Preventive Measures</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Use lowest FiO<sub>2</sub> that maintains adequate oxygenation</li>\r\n<li>Monitor ABGs and oxygen saturation closely</li>\r\n<li>In neonates: use blended oxygen and preductal SpO<sub>2</sub> monitoring</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Cough (<strong>option </strong>A) : Prolonged oxygen therapy can lead to irritation of the respiratory tract, resulting in a persistent dry cough.</li>\r\n<li>Pulmonary Edema (<strong>option </strong>C) : High concentrations of oxygen can increase the production of reactive oxygen species, leading to capillary leakage and subsequent pulmonary edema.</li>\r\n<li>Absorptive atelectasis (<strong>option </strong>D): High concentrations of oxygen displace nitrogen in the alveoli. Since oxygen is rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream, the alveoli can collapse, especially if ventilation is compromised. This is called <strong>absorptive or resorption atelectasis</strong>.</li>\r\n</ul>",
