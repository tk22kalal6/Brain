Oligodendroglial cells provide myelination for brain neuronal axons.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Incorrect Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Astrocytes (Option A):</strong> These glial cells primarily function in supporting neurons, maintaining the blood-brain barrier, and regulating extracellular ion balance. They do not typically undergo acute ischemic or hypoglycemic changes like eosinophilic cytoplasm, nuclear pyknosis, or central chromatolysis. Instead, they react later through hypertrophy and hyperplasia (reactive gliosis).</p>\n<p><strong>Endothelial cells (Option B):</strong> These cells line cerebral blood vessels and are crucial in maintaining the blood-brain barrier. They are not the primary cells to undergo morphological injury in hypoglycemia. Damage to endothelial cells occurs more in conditions such as ischemic stroke, trauma, or inflammatory processes, rather than hypoglycemia-induced neuronal death.</p>\n<p><strong>Microglia (Option C):</strong> These are the resident macrophages of the CNS and act as immune surveillance cells. In hypoglycemia, microglia are activated secondarily in response to neuronal injury, where they phagocytose necrotic debris. They are not the first cells to show the cytoplasmic eosinophilia, spheroidal swellings, or pyknosis described in the vignette.</p>",
