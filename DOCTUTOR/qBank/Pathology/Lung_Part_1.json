      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>The given clinical presentation with cavitary lesions in the chest x-ray suggests <strong>tuberculosis</strong>. Cavitatory lesions in TB result from an immune-mediated response involving epithelioid cells, Langhans giant cells, and macrophages, which form granulomas that undergo caseous necrosis and cavitation.</p>\n<p><strong>TB Pathogenesis: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>M.tuberculosis enters macrophages by phagocytosis. Bacteria proliferate in the <strong>pulmonary alveolar macrophages</strong> and air spaces, resulting in bacteremia and seeding of multiple sites.</li>\n<li>These result in innate and adaptive immune responses to M. tuberculosis, causing Th1-mediated macrophage activation and killing of bacteria.</li>\n<li>In addition to stimulating macrophages to kill mycobacteria, the Th1 response orchestrates the formation of granulomas and caseous necrosis.</li>\n<li>Macrophages activated by IFN-&gamma; differentiate into the <strong>epithelioid histiocytes</strong> that aggregate to form granulomas; some epithelioid cells may fuse to form multinucleated giant cells<strong> (Langhans giant cells)</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Histology features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Histologically, sites of active involvement are marked by a characteristic granulomatous inflammatory reaction that forms both <strong>caseating and noncaseating tubercles.</strong></li>\n<li>Individual tubercles are microscopic; it is only when multiple granulomas coalesce that they become macroscopically visible.</li>\n<li>The granulomas are usually enclosed within a fibroblastic rim punctuated by lymphocytes.
