      "solution": "<ul>\r\n<li>Acute inflammation of a gallbladder that contains stones is termed acute calculous cholecystitis and is precipitated in 90% of cases by obstruction of the gallbladder neck or cystic duct.</li>\r\n<li>It is the most common major complication of gallstones and the most frequent indication for emergency cholecystectomy. Manifestations of obstruction may appear with remarkable suddenness and constitute a surgical emergency.</li>\r\n<li>Calculous cholecystitis is the most common, and usually less serious, type of acute cholecystitis. It accounts for around 95% of all cases.</li>\r\n<li>Calculous cholecystitis develops when the main opening to the gallbladder, called the cystic duct, gets blocked by a gallstone or by a substance known as biliary sludge.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Reference:</strong> Robbins Basic Pathology, 10<sup>th</sup> ed, Pg-674</p>",
