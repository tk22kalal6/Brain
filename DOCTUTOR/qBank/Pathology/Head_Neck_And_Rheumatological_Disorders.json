The crystals form chalky, white friable deposits, which are seen histologically in hematoxylin- and eosin-stained preparations as oval blue-purple aggregates.

Individuals with sickle cell disease are prone to infection with Salmonella.</li>\n<li>These joint infections affect the sexes equally, except for gonococcal arthritis, which is seen mainly in sexually active women. Individuals with deficiencies of complement components (C5, C6, C7, or C9) are susceptible to disseminated gonococcal infections and hence arthritis.</li>\n<li>The classic presentation is the sudden development of an acutely painful, warm, and swollen joint that has a restricted range of motion.
