It commonly affects small arteries and arterioles, especially in the kidneys, and is frequently associated with <strong>benign hypertension</strong> and <strong>diabetes mellitus</strong>.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\r\n<p>This 55-year-old female presents with a <strong>large adnexal mass</strong>, <strong>raised inhibin levels</strong>, and <strong>histopathological findings</strong> of <strong>cords and sheets of tumor cells with nuclear grooves</strong>.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>These findings are <strong>classic for granulosa cell tumor</strong>, a <strong>sex cord-stromal tumor</strong> of the ovary.</li>\r\n<li>Key features supporting the diagnosis:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Age group:</strong> Typically occurs in <strong>postmenopausal women</strong>, though it can also be seen in younger females.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Hormonal activity:</strong> Granulosa cell tumors are often <strong>estrogen-producing</strong>, leading to <strong>endometrial hyperplasia</strong>, <strong>postmenopausal bleeding</strong>, or even <strong>precocious puberty</strong> in younger girls.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Tumor marker:</strong> <strong>Inhibin</strong> (especially <strong>inhibin B</strong>) is a <strong>sensitive tumor marker</strong> for granulosa cell tumors.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Histology:</strong> Shows <strong>Call-Exner bodies</strong> (small follicle-like structures filled with eosinophilic fluid) and \"<strong>coffee bean\" nuclei</strong> with <strong>longitudinal nuclear grooves</strong>.<strong></strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Explanation of Incorrect Options:</strong><strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Choriocarcinoma (Option A):</strong>Choriocarcinoma is a highly malignant <strong>germ cell tumor</strong> associated with <strong>elevated &beta;-hCG</strong>, not inhibin. It shows <strong>cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts</strong> on histology, and is often associated with <strong>hemorrhage and necrosis</strong>. It does not show nuclear grooves or cord-like arrangements.<strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Yolk Sac Tumor (Option C): </strong>Also known as <strong>endodermal sinus tumor</strong>, it is a <strong>germ cell tumor</strong> that typically elevates <strong>AFP (alpha-fetoprotein)</strong>, not inhibin. Histology shows <strong>Schiller-Duval bodies</strong> (central vessel surrounded by tumor cells in a cystic space), not nuclear grooves.<strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Leydig Cell Tumor (Option D): </strong>Leydig cell tumors are <strong>sex cord-stromal tumors</strong> that produce <strong>androgens</strong>, leading to <strong>virilization</strong>. They are typically identified by <strong>Reinke crystals</strong> on histology and do <strong>not show nuclear grooves</strong> or elevated inhibin levels.</p>",
