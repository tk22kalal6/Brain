      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>The most likely diagnosis based on the given clinical vignette of hematuria following an upper respiratory tract infection is <strong>acute proliferative glomerulonephritis</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Acute proliferative glomerulonephritis represents a group of conditions defined by a histological pattern involving widespread <strong>glomerular cell proliferation</strong> and an influx of leukocytes, often caused by immune complex deposition.</li>\n<li>It presents as nephritic syndrome which is marked by hematuria, hypertension, proteinuria, and azotemia.</li>\n<li>The triggering antigen may originate either from an external infection or from within the body. A prime example is<strong> post-infectious glomerulonephritis</strong>, especially poststreptococcal GN, which generally occurs <strong>1 - 4 weeks</strong> after a <strong>streptococcal throat or skin infection</strong> (like impetigo).</li>\n<li>Poststreptococcal GN results from immune complexes containing streptococcal antigens and antibodies. Only certain <strong>nephritogenic strains</strong> of group A &beta;-hemolytic streptococci (notably types 12, 4, and 1, identifiable by M protein typing) are responsible for most cases.</li>\n<li>The interval between infection and nephritis aligns with the time needed for antibody production and immune complex formation. These immune complexes, especially those containing the exotoxin SpeB (streptococcal pyogenic exotoxin B), <strong>activate complement</strong> and cause inflammation.</li>\n<li>Similar glomerulonephritis can also occur from other bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections (e.g., endocarditis, hepatitis B/C, varicella, malaria).</li>\n<li>Histologically, the glomeruli are enlarged and <strong>hypercellular</strong> due to leukocyte infiltration (neutrophils and monocytes), proliferation of endothelial and mesangial cells, and sometimes crescent formation.</li>\n<li>Immunofluorescence reveals <strong>granular IgG and C3 deposits</strong>, and sometimes IgM, in the mesangium and along the GBM, indicating immune complex-mediated injury.</li>\n<li>Electron microscopy shows <strong>irregular, dense subepithelial deposits</strong> (\"humps\"), with additional subendothelial and mesangial involvement, especially early in the disease.</li>\n<li>A typical presentation in children includes <strong>sudden onset of malaise, fever, nausea, oliguria</strong>, and <strong>dark (cola-colored) urine 1-2 weeks after a sore throat</strong>.</li>\n<li>Edema, mild proteinuria (&lt;1 g/day), hematuria, and <strong>moderate hypertension</strong> are common.</li>\n<li>Over 95% of affected children recover renal function with supportive therapy. A small subset may progress to rapidly progressive GN.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Membranous nephropathy (Option B):</strong> Membranous nephropathy presents with insidious onset of <strong>nephrotic syndrome</strong> characterised by marked proteinuria, generalised edema, and hyperlipidemia. Most cases are idiopathic, but secondary forms are linked to <strong>drugs, infections, malignancies</strong>, autoimmune diseases, and systemic conditions. Histologically, electron-dense deposits cause <strong>spike-like projections</strong> from the basement membrane.</p>\n<p><strong>Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (Option C):</strong> One of the most frequent cause of <strong>nephrotic syndrome</strong> in <strong>adults</strong>, marked by focal and segmental scarring of glomeruli, often linked to podocyte injury and presenting with proteinuria, hypertension, hematuria, and azotemia.It is considered a <strong>podocytopathy</strong>, much like minimal change disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (Option D):</strong> It is not a single disease but a form of immune-mediated glomerular injury and is currently classified into two types: Type I, involving <strong>immune complexes</strong> of IgG and complement, and Type II (dense deposit disease), which is driven by <strong>complement dysregulation</strong>. Clinically, MPGN often appears during adolescence or early adulthood with <strong>nephrotic syndrome</strong> and may also include a nephritic component such as hematuria or mild proteinuria.</p>",

It presents as nephrotic syndrome and is currently categorized into two primary forms: Type I, which involves deposits of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and complement, and Type II (also referred to as dense deposit disease) where dysregulation of the complement pathway is the main pathogenic factor.</p>\n<p><strong>Membranous nephropathy (Option D):</strong> Membranous nephropathy begins gradually with <strong>nephrotic syndrome</strong> marked by significant protein loss in urine, widespread swelling, and elevated lipid levels. While the majority of cases occur without an obvious underlying cause (idiopathic), some are secondary to factors such as certain <strong>medications, infections</strong>, cancers, autoimmune disorders, or systemic diseases. On microscopic examination, a hallmark feature is the presence of electron-dense immune deposits along the <strong>subepithelial</strong> aspect of the glomerular basement membrane, which stimulate the formation of distinctive <strong>spike-like extensions</strong>.</p>",

A characteristic <strong>\"double-contour\"</strong> or <strong>\"tram-track\"</strong> appearance is seen especially on <strong>silver</strong> and <strong>PAS stains</strong>. It results from basement membrane duplication around subendothelial immune deposits, with <strong>frequent crescent formation</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Membranous nephropathy (Option D):</strong> Membranous nephropathy typically presents insidiously with features of <strong>nephrotic syndrome</strong>, including heavy proteinuria, generalized edema, and hyperlipidemia. Most cases are idiopathic, though some arise secondary to triggers like specific drugs, infections, malignancies, autoimmune diseases, or systemic illnesses. On light microscopy, glomeruli may look unremarkable in the initial phases of the disease or may show a consistent, <strong>widespread thickening of the capillary walls.

The pathogenesis involves deposition of <strong>immune complexes</strong> in the glomeruli, which triggers an inflammatory response. Histologically, the glomeruli appear <strong>markedly enlarged and hypercellular</strong> due to proliferation of both mesangial and endothelial cells. This is compounded by infiltration of inflammatory cells, particularly neutrophils and monocytes.</p>\n<p><strong>Crescentic nephritis (Option B): </strong>Rapidly progressive (crescentic) glomerulonephritis (RPGN) is a clinical entity marked by a swift and <strong>continuous decline in renal function</strong> due to severe glomerular injury, often associated with the presence of <strong>crescents in glomeruli</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Minimal change disease (Option C): </strong>Minimal change disease, the most frequent cause of nephrotic syndrome in children aged 2 - 6, is characterized by diffuse podocyte foot process effacement visible only on electron microscopy, with <strong>normal glomeruli under light microscopy </strong>and absence of immune deposits.</p>",
