If you can feel a pulse but the pulse rate is less than 60 beats per minute, you should begin CPR. This rate is too slow for a child.</li>\n<li>After doing CPR for about two minutes (usually about five cycles of 30 compressions and two breaths), and if help has not arrived, call EMS while staying with the child. The ILCOR emphasises that cell phones are available everywhere now, and most have a built-in speakerphone. Get an AED if you know where one is.</li>\n<li>Use and follow AED prompts when available while continuing CPR until EMS arrives or until the child's condition normalises.</li>\n</ul><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGUPDATEDMCQ/202509078bd9b.png\">",
