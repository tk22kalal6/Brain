Reye syndrome involves acute non-inflammatory encephalopathy and hepatic dysfunction, with high mortality. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is the preferred antipyretic in chickenpox.</p>\n<p><strong>Antipruritic agents like Cetirizine can be safely given (Option B):</strong> Chickenpox causes intense itching, which can lead to scratching and secondary bacterial infection. Oral antihistamines like cetirizine, levocetirizine, or hydroxyzine are used to relieve pruritus. These agents are safe and effective in both children and adults.</p>\n<p><strong>Acyclovir should be started within 24-48 hr of rash for optimum efficacy, if indicated (Option C):</strong> Oral acyclovir (20 mg/kg/dose 4 times/day for 5 days), when started within 24 hours of rash onset, reduces duration of fever, total number of lesions and formation of new lesions. It is not routinely required in healthy, immunocompetent children but is indicated for adolescents, immunocompromised individuals, neonates and for complicated or severe varicella</p><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3d535v34tlady.cloudfront.net/V2NEETPGMCQ/20241022070f5082-0bc6-40a6-b316-0faddd5b1290.jpg\">",
