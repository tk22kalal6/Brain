The workup of children with complex febrile seizures needs to be individualised. This can include an EEG and neuroimaging, particularly if the child is neurologically abnormal.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Initiate daily antiepileptic therapy with valproate (Option D): </strong>Continuous therapy with the antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) phenobarbital or valproic acid, were occasionally used to prevent febrile seizures. However, in the vast majority of cases, use of continuous therapy is not justified because of the risk of side effects and lack of demonstrated long-&shy; term benefits, even if the recurrence rate of febrile seizures is expected to be decreased by these drugs. Chronic antiepileptic therapy may be considered for children with a high risk for later epilepsy.
