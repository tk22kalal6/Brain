There is usually little to see, but shoulder movements are restricted in all directions. Pain is common, particularly at night. X-rays show distortion of the joint, bone sclerosis and osteophyte formation; the articular space may be narrowed or may show calcification.</p>\n<p><strong>Septic arthritis (Option D): </strong>Acute septic arthritis is associated with tenderness and swelling localised to the joint. Movement at the joint is painful and restricted. Diagnosis is confirmed with aspiration of synovial fluid under strict aseptic conditions, and the fluid is examined for inflammatory cells.</p>",
