Chronic inflammation distends the common sheath of the flexor tendons both above and below the flexor retinaculum. Rheumatoid arthritis and tuberculosis are the commonest causes. Pain is unusual, but paraesthesia due to median nerve compression may occur. A characteristic hourglass swelling bulging above and below the flexor retinaculum is seen.</p>\n<p><strong>Carpal tunnel syndrome (Option B): </strong>This is a syndrome characterised by the compression of the median nerve as it passes beneath the flexor retinaculum. The patient is generally a middle-aged woman complaining of tingling, numbness or discomfort in the thumb and radial one and a half fingers, e., in the median nerve distribution. These symptoms can be elicited by <strong>Phalen's test.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Tennis elbow (Option D): </strong>This is a condition characterised by pain and tenderness at the lateral epicondyle of the humerus due to non-specific inflammation at the origin of the extensor muscles of the forearm. <strong>Cozen's test </strong>is a clinical test to diagnose tennis elbow.</p>",
