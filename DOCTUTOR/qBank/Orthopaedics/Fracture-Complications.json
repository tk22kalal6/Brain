Any obstruction to the brachial artery caused by tight plaster, improper use of a tourniquet can also lead to Volkmann&rsquo;s ischemic contracture (VIC).</li>\n<li>There are four compartments in the forearm: (1) dorsal, (2) superficial volar, (3) deep volar and (4) compartment containing the mobile wad of Henry (brachioradialis, extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis). The volar (flexor) compartment is the most commonly involved compartment with<strong>flexor digitorum profundus (FDP)</strong>andthe <strong>median nerve</strong>being the most commonly involved muscles and nerve in VIC, respectively.</li>\n<li><strong>The earliest feature of a compartment syndrome is pain on passive stretch of fingers.</strong></li>\n<li>In mild cases of VIC, only FDPs of the two or three fingers are involved.<strong>The middle and ring fingers are most frequently involved</strong>, sothe <strong>earliest feature of VIC will be pain on passive stretch of the middle and ring fingers. (The thumb is not primarily involved in the early phase of forearm flexor ischemia.) (Option C ruled out)</strong></li>\n<li>Moderate involvement: After the FDP, the flexor pollicis longus muscle is commonly involved. Other muscles, the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS), flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) may also be involved later.</li>\n<li><strong>Typical deformity is the intrinsic-minus hand deformity (claw hand)</strong>from extrinsic muscle contracture [hyperextension at the MCP joint and flexion at interphalangeal (IP) joints]. Concomitant median and ulnar nerve neuropathy further contributes to claw hand deformity in addition to sensory changes. <strong>(Option D ruled out)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Severe involvement</strong>: Along with the forearm flexor compartment, extensors are also involved to a varying extent. However, the clinical picture is still that of only flexor involvement because of the strong and larger flexors. With severe cases, there are elbow flexion, forearm pronation, wrist flexion, thumb flexion and adduction, digital MCP joint extension and IP joint flexion. <strong>Skin changes </strong>occur later. <strong>(Option A ruled out)</strong></li>\n</ul>",
