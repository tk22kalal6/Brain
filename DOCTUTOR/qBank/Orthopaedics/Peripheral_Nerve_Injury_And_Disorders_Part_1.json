      "solution": "<strong>Explanation:</strong>\n<p>The lady is suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Carpal tunnel syndrome(tardive median palsy) is the result of compression of the median nerve within the carpal tunnel as it passes beneath the flexor retinaculum.\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\" https://d3d535v34tlady.cloudfront.net/NEETPGMCQ/202312216abad968-1dc4-4c0e-8c72-6235bd70ccda.jpg\">\n</li>\n<li>Clinical findings:\n<ul>\n<li>Carpal tunnel syndrome is most common in the fourth to sixth decades of life and occurs more often in women than in men.</li>\n<li>Carpal tunnel syndrome consists predominantly of tingling and numbness in the typical median nerve distribution in the radial three and a half digits (thumb, index, long and radial side of ring).</li>\n<li>Tingling is more prominent during sleep. Frequently causes the patient to awaken several hours after falling asleep with burning and numbness in the hand, which is relieved by exercise.</li>\n<li>Pain, described as deep, aching or throbbing, occurs diffusely in the hand and radiates up the forearm.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Tests for carpal tunnel syndrome are:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Percussion test(Tinel sign):</strong>Tapping over the median nerve at the mid-axis of the wrist elicits electric-shock-like discomfort at the site of the tap with paresthesias that radiate distally into the median nerve distribution(positive Tinel sign).</li>\n<li><strong>Phalen test(or Phalen manoeuvre):</strong>The Phalen manoeuvre provokes median nerve compression by active hyperflexion of the wrist; this test is considered positive if paresthesias in a median nerve distribution develop within 60 seconds.</li>\n<li><strong>Tourniquet test:</strong>The development of numbness and tingling in the fingers in the median nerve distribution after an inflated blood pressure cuff is placed on the upper arm suggests carpal tunnel syndrome.</li>\n<li><strong>Durkan compression test:</strong>Compression is applied to the median nerve for 30 seconds with the thumbs or an atomiser bulb attached to a manometer. Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome typically experience symptoms of numbness, pain, or paresthesia in the distribution of the median nerve.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Cozen's test (Option A):</strong> Elicits pain in the lateral epicondyle, used for diagnosing <strong>tennis elbow</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Finkelstein test (Option B):</strong> Used to diagnose <strong>De Quervain's tenosynovitis</strong>, not related to the median nerve.</p>\n<p><strong>Eichhoff test (Option D):</strong> Also used in De Quervain's tenosynovitis by passive ulnar deviation-irrelevant to carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway: </strong> Phalen's test is a classic diagnostic manoeuvre for carpal tunnel syndrome, reproducing symptoms via wrist flexion.</p>",
