      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>Markers for post arthroplasty joint infection</p>\n<ol>\n<li>ESR and CRP currently remain as first-line screening tests for periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). They have high sensitivity and low specificity. CRP is more sensitive and specific than ESR.</li>\n<li>Interleukin-6 (IL-6)- IL-6 is an inflammatory cytokine produced by stimulated monocytes and macrophages. It induces the production of acute-phase proteins, including CRP.</li>\n<li>White blood cell count (WBC)- While synovial WBC count and differential is one of the main diagnostic criteria for PJI, serum WBC count has very little utility.</li>\n<li>Procalcitonin (PCT)- It is a protein produced by neuroendocrine cells and the parafollicular cells of the thyroid under physiological conditions. In sepsis, the main producers of PCT are macrophages and monocytic cells of different organs, especially the liver. PCT has a high diagnostic accuracy for the identification of systemic infection but for joint infection it has low sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy.</li>\n<li>D-dimer- Serum D-dimer has been shown to outperform other conventional tests such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein in diagnosis of PJI. It has sensitivity and specificity higher than the ESR and CRP and has emerged as a promising tool for diagnosis of PJI.</li>\n<li>Tumor necrosis factor-alfa (TNF-alfa)- It has high specificity and low sensitivity for PJI. Technical drawbacks include long processing times (over two hours) and the instability of the sample, which means it needs to be processed within 60 minutes of being drawn. Therefore, based on these results, TNF-a is not an ideal serum screening test for PJI.</li>\n<li>Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is a membrane glycoprotein that plays a key role in leukocyte migration and activation that has also been studied in the context of PJI. It may also be considered as good markers of infection, as measurement of its levels allows for differentiating patients with and without infection, and between patients with infection and those with previous infection, since marker levels quickly return to baseline values after clearance of the infection.</li>\n</ol>",
