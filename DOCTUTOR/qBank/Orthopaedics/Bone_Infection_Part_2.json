Other predisposing factors are poor hygiene, poor resistance, diabetes, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Staphylococcus aureus</strong><strong>is the commonest causative organism.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The knee is the most commonly affected joint</strong>. Other joints commonly affected are the hip, shoulder, elbow, etc.</li>\n<li>As the organism reaches the joint by various routes(hematogenous/direct trauma), there begins an inflammatory response in the synovium, resulting in the exudation of fluid within the joint. Joint cartilage is destroyed by inflammatory granulation tissue and lysosomal enzymes in the joint exudate. The outcome varies from complete healing to destruction of the joint. The latter may result in a complete loss of joint movement(ankylosis).</li>\n<li>Septic arthritis presents with a severe throbbing pain, swelling and redness of the affected joint. This is associated with high-grade fever and malaise.</li>\n<li><strong>Blood</strong>shows neutrophilic leucocytosis. ESR is markedly elevated. A blood culture may grow the causative organism. <strong>Joint aspiration</strong> is the quickest and best method of diagnosing septic arthritis. The fluid may show features of acute septic inflammation.</li>\n<li>A combination of Ceftriaxone and Cloxacillin, in appropriate doses, is usually given. These are subsequently changed to specific antibiotics as per aspirate culture and sensitivity reports. The joint must be put to rest in a splint or in traction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Shoulder (Option B):</strong> Less frequently involved; often seen in IV drug users or post-injection.</p>\n<p><strong>Hip (Option C):</strong> Common in neonates and infants but not the primary site in older adults.</p>\n<p><strong>Elbow (Option D):</strong> May be affected, but is far less common than the knee.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>The knee joint is the most commonly affected site in septic arthritis, particularly in diabetic and elderly patients.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>Paravertebral disc oedema is not a known direct compressive factor in spinal tuberculosis leading to paraplegia. Pott's paraplegia occurs because of pressure on the neural tissues within the canal by products from the diseased vertebrae. It could occur in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Inflammatory oedema:</strong>The neural tissues become oedematous because of vascular stasis in the adjacent diseased area.</li>\n<li><strong>Extradural pus and granulation tissue:</strong>This is the commonest cause of compression on neural structures. The abscess formed around the diseased vertebrae may compress the neural structures from the front, much the same way as an extradural tumour.</li>\n<li><strong>Sequestra:</strong>Devascularised bone and extruded disc material may be displaced into the canal.</li>\n<li><strong>Internal 'gibbus':</strong>Angulation of the diseased spine may lead to the formation of the bony ridge on the anterior wall of the spinal canal. This is called the internal gibbus</li>\n<li><strong>Infarction of the spinal cord:</strong>This is an unusual but important cause of paralysis. It results from the blockage of the anterior spinal artery, caused by the inflammatory reaction.</li>\n<li><strong>Extradural granuloma:</strong>Very rarely, an extradural granuloma may form without any damage to the osseous structures. Such a patient presents with a clinical picture of a spinal tumour - the so-called 'Spinal tumour syndrome'.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Stretching of the spinal cord in gibbus deformity (Option A):</strong> Mechanical stretching over the internal gibbus is a recognised cause.</p>\n<p><strong>Compression by granulation tissue (Option C):</strong> The Commonest cause of Pott's paraplegia.</p>\n<p><strong>Oedema of the spinal cord (Option D):</strong> Inflammatory cause contributing to neural dysfunction.</p>",

On X-ray, all that is visible is a widened joint space due to effusion and generalised osteopenia.</li>\n<li>Stage 2 (Stage of early arthritis): With the advancement of the disease process, there is destruction of articular cartilage. With spasm of flexors and adductors of the hip, there is flexion, adduction and internal rotation deformity with apparent shortening. True shortening is also present due to damage to articular cartilage, but is less than 1 cm. X-ray shows a decrease in joint space and osteopenia.</li>\n<li>Stage 3 (Stage of late arthritis): With further destruction, clinical signs of flexion, adduction, internal rotation deformities and apparent shortening are exaggerated. True shortening is more than 1 cm. Here is a gross restriction of movements and muscle wasting. X-rays may show complete loss of joint space with destruction of the head/acetabulum.</li>\n<li>Stage 4 (Late arthritis with subluxation/dislocation): There are flexion, adduction and internal rotation deformities with gross shortening. With destruction of the acetabulum, femur head and ligaments, the upper end of the femur may displace upwards and dorsally, leaving the lower part of the acetabulum empty but forming a false acetabulum higher up (wandering acetabulum).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Stage 2 (Option B):</strong> Early arthritis stage; joint starts showing cartilage destruction with apparent and true shortening due to adduction and internal rotation.</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 3 (Option C):</strong> Late arthritis; deformities worsen, and <strong>true shortening</strong> is more than 1 cm due to bony destruction.</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 4 (Option D):</strong> Subluxation/dislocation phase; gross <strong>true shortening</strong> occurs due to proximal and posterior displacement of the femoral head (wandering acetabulum).</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>Apparent limb lengthening is a hallmark of early TB synovitis of the hip (Stage 1) due to muscle relaxation and joint positioning.</p>",
