Such a cavity can harbour infections and cause the recurrence of osteomyelitis. In order to prevent this, we keep these antibiotic-loaded PMMA (bone cement beads). This serves 2 purposes:<ol><li>It fills up the cavity and prevents the collection of fluids.</li><li>It releases antibiotics, which will have a local microbicidal effect.</li></ol></li></ul><p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p><p><strong>Open reduction internal fixation (Option A):</strong> Involves fixation of fractures, not appropriate in an active infective cavity.</p><p><strong>Sacrerization with bone grafting (Option B):</strong> Involves debridement and defect filling, but not with antibiotic beads.</p><p><strong>PMMA bone cement used for gap filling (Option C):</strong> PMMA may be used alone as filler, but the key here is antibiotic loading for infection control.<br /> </p><p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p><p>Antibiotic-loaded PMMA beads are a preferred adjunctive measure post-debridement in chronic osteomyelitis for both structural and antimicrobial benefit.</p>",
