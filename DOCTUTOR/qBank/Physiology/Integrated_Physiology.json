Symptoms include visual disturbances, dizziness, nausea, muscle twitching, and seizures (<strong>Paul Bert effect</strong>).</li>\r\n<li><strong>Option B: Reactive oxygen species (ROS)</strong> such as superoxide anions, hydroxyl radicals, and hydrogen peroxide are generated at high oxygen pressures. These ROS:</li>\r\n<li>Oxidize <strong>polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)</strong> in cell membranes, damaging membrane integrity.</li>\r\n<li>Inactivate vital <strong>enzymes</strong>, disrupting cellular metabolism.</li>\r\n<li>Induce <strong>DNA damage and apoptosis</strong> when severe.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Option C: </strong>At a pressure of <strong>4 atmospheres</strong> (about 100 feet underwater), the amount of dissolved oxygen in blood increases significantly, from around 2 ml/100 ml at 1 atm to <strong>nearly 9 ml/100 ml</strong>, contributing to toxicity risk.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>K</strong><strong>ey Takeaway:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>At high tissue oxygen levels (high pO2), molecular oxygen is converted into<strong> reactive oxygen species</strong> like superoxide anions.
