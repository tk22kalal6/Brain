      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the fetal period, the pulmonary epithelial cells secrete Cl<sup>-</sup> ions into the alveolar space. This secretion draws water osmotically, resulting in the presence of fluid-filled lungs during intrauterine life, an essential component for lung development.</li>\n<li>At birth, there is a <strong>physiological shift</strong> from <strong>Cl<sup>-</sup>secretion to Na<sup>+</sup> absorption</strong> in the pulmonary epithelium. This shift is mediated by the activation of <strong>ENaC (epithelial sodium channels)</strong> located on the apical membrane of alveolar epithelial cells.</li>\n<li>These ENaC channels absorb Na<sup>+</sup> from the alveolar space into the interstitium.</li>\n<li>Water follows sodium osmotically, leading to clearance of lung fluid and preparing the alveoli for air inflation as the baby takes its first breaths.</li>\n<li>If there is deficient ENaC activity, this fluid is not adequately reabsorbed, resulting in retention of alveolar fluid, impaired gas exchange, and respiratory distress. This mechanism is a key contributor to Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn (TTN).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Na+ channels present on the membrane of pulmonary epithelial cells are called ENaC (epithelial Na+ channels).</li>\n<li>ENaC channels cause absorption of Na+. Along with Na+ fluid is also absorbed from the alveoli allowing the lungs to easily expand as the baby cries.</li>\n</ul>",
