      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>Enzymes exhibit high specificity, acting on specific substrates or catalyzing specific types of reactions. The statement \"Human enzymes act only on D-amino acids\" is incorrect because human enzymes predominantly act on <strong>L-amino acids</strong>. While D-amino acids exist in nature (e.g., in bacterial cell walls, some peptide antibiotics), the vast majority of proteins in humans are composed of L-amino acids, and human enzymes involved in protein synthesis and metabolism are stereospecific for the L-configuration. Conversely, human enzymes act almost exclusively on <strong>D-carbohydrates</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enzyme Specificity:</strong> Enzymes are highly specific, determined by the precise fit between the active site and the substrate. This can be:\n<ul>\n<li>Enzyme acts on only one substrate (e.g., Urease acts only on urea).</li>\n<li>Enzyme acts on a group of chemically related substrates (e.g., Hexokinase phosphorylates several hexoses).</li>\n<li>Enzymes act on only one stereoisomeric form of a substrate.</li>\n<li>Enzymes catalyze only one type of reaction (e.g., decarboxylase only catalyzes decarboxylation).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Stereospecificity in Humans:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Human enzymes typically act on <strong>L-amino acids</strong>.</li>\n<li>Human enzymes typically act on <strong>D-carbohydrates</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Glucokinase phosphorylates only glucose (Option A):</strong> Glucokinase is an enzyme primarily found in the liver and pancreas, and it exhibits a high degree of specificity, primarily phosphorylating only glucose to glucose 6-phosphate.</p>\n<p><strong>Hexokinase exhibits relative substrate specificity (Option B):</strong> Hexokinase, found in most tissues, can phosphorylate not only glucose but also other hexoses like fructose, mannose, and glucosamine. This demonstrates its relative (or group) substrate specificity, as opposed to absolute specificity.</p>\n<p><strong>Glucose 6-phosphate undergoes multiple reactions, each catalysed by a separate enzyme (Option C):</strong> Glucose 6-phosphate is a branching point in metabolism. It can be converted to glucose (by glucose 6-phosphatase), oxidized in the pentose phosphate pathway (by glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase), or isomerized to fructose 6-phosphate (by phosphoglucose isomerase). Each of these distinct transformations is catalyzed by a different, specific enzyme, illustrating reaction specificity.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>Enzymes exhibit various levels of specificity, including stereospecificity. A crucial point in human biochemistry is that enzymes primarily recognize and act upon <strong>L-amino acids</strong> and <strong>D-carbohydrates</strong>, making the statement about D-amino acids incorrect.</p>",
