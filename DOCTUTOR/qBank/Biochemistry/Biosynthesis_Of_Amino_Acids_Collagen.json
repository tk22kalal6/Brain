Alanine transfers nitrogen via transamination to glutamate, which undergoes oxidative deamination to release ammonia.</p>\n<p><strong>ATP in argininosuccinate to arginine (Option B)</strong>: <strong>Argininosuccinate &rarr; arginine</strong> is catalysed by <strong>argininosuccinate lyase</strong> and <strong>does not require ATP</strong>. ATP is used earlier in the <strong>argininosuccinate synthetase</strong> step.</p>\n<p><strong>Only in cytoplasm (Option D)</strong>: The urea cycle occurs in both <strong>mitochondrial matrix</strong> (first 2 steps) and <strong>cytosol</strong> (last 3 steps). Hence, it is a <strong>bi-compartmental cycle</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The urea cycle is upregulated in high-protein states.</li>\n<li>Two nitrogen atoms in urea come from ammonia and aspartate.</li>\n<li>It uses 3 ATP per cycle and occurs in both mitochondria and cytosol.</li>\n</ul>",
