Cyclosporine is used to treat specific cases of severe Crohn's, including <strong>fistulous complications.</strong> But its use is limited due to significant adverse effects like increased susceptibility to infections, renal insufficiency, hypertension, seizures, and peripheral neuropathy.</p>\n<p><strong>Controlled ileal release- budesonide therapy (Option C): </strong>Budesonide is used for the induction of remission in mild-to-moderate Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, particularly in distal disease. It is available as retention enemas.</p>\n<p><strong>Proctocolectomy (Option D):</strong> Proctocolectomy is the surgical removal of the colon and rectum and is primarily the surgical management of ulcerative colitis. In contrast, Crohn's disease is a chronic, incurable inflammatory condition that may involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract. Surgery in Crohn's disease is reserved for medical treatment failure or life-threatening complications, and is typically limited to segmental resections or stricturoplasty.</p>\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height: auto; display: block; vertical-align: middle; border: 0;\" src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGUPDATEDMCQ/20250906d20016f2-9fb4-4835-b0ec-13a5ad5cd632.png\">",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Parietal cells have five receptors regulating acid secretion: three excitatory (for acetylcholine, gastrin, and histamine) and two inhibitory.

The effects of acetylcholine and gastrin are largely indirect, mediated through histamine release.</li>\n<li>During a meal, all three secretagogues act together, producing a potentiated effect greater than their individual effects combined due to synergistic G-protein signalling.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Effect of atropine on gastric acid secretion:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Atropine is a <strong>muscarinic receptor antagonist</strong>, competitively inhibits the action of acetylcholine (ACh) at parasympathetic sites.</li>\n<li>Atropine only partially inhibits the gastric acid secretory responses to vagal activity because vagal stimulation of gastrin secretion is mediated not by ACh but by peptidergic neurons in the vagal trunk that release gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP).</li>\n<li>GRP stimulates gastrin release from G cells; gastrin can act directly to promote acid secretion by parietal cells and to stimulate histamine release from enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells.</li>\n<li>Parietal cells (acid secretors) respond to at least three agonists: gastrin, histamine, and ACh.</li>\n<li>Atropine will inhibit only the components of acid secretion that result from muscarinic stimulation of parietal cells and muscarinic stimulation of ECL cells that secrete histamine.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\n<p>Effects of atropine in the GIT:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduces gastric acid secretion</li>\n<li>Inhibitory effect on GI motility</li>\n</ul>",
