This patient's score is 1, so the focus should first be on controlling the underlying thyroid cause and arrhythmia symptoms.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Propylthiouracil (PTU) (Option C):</strong> PTU is an antithyroid drug that reduces thyroid hormone synthesis, but its effect is delayed (takes days to weeks). Symptom control must come first with a beta-blocker before initiating or in conjunction with PTU or other definitive therapies.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Amiodarone (Option D):</strong> Though effective for rhythm control, amiodarone is iodine-rich and can worsen or trigger thyroid dysfunction, especially in someone already hyperthyroid. It is not appropriate as first-line therapy in this setting.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway: </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Propranolol</strong> is the first-line treatment for immediate symptom control in hyperthyroid-induced adrenergic symptoms, including atrial fibrillation, making it the most appropriate initial management step.</p>",
