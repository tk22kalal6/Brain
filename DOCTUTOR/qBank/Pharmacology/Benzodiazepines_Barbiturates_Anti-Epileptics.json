      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Carbamazepine is a common antiepileptic drug used for the treatment of both generalised seizures and focal seizures. In rare cases, it can also cause an acute drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS), which may present with fever and a diffuse morbilliform rash that progresses to a confluent erythema with accentuation of the hair follicles, as well as facial oedema and lymphadenopathy.</li>\r\n<li>HSS usually develops 2-8 weeks after initiating treatment and is also referred to as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), as further symptoms include hematologic abnormalities (e.g., leukocytosis with eosinophilia), and internal organ involvement (e.g., hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis).</li>\r\n<li>Carbamazepine should be discontinued immediately, and this patient should now transition to a different antiepileptic medication (e.g., valproic acid) to avoid life-threatening complications.</li>\r\n<li>Other important side effects of carbamazepine include diplopia, vertigo, agranulocytosis, hyponatremia (due to SIADH), and dermatologic reactions (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Monospot test (Option A)</strong> is the diagnostic test of choice for infectious mononucleosis. It can manifest with fever, lymphadenopathy and a rash (typically prompted by administration of aminopenicillin). However, the absence of other hallmark features of the disease, such as fatigue, splenomegaly, and pharyngotonsillitis, makes this diagnosis unlikely in this patient.</p>\r\n<p>Administration of topical clotrimazole <strong>(Option B)</strong> is indicated in fungal infections, such as tinea. Tinea is a superficial dermatophyte infection characterised by scaly patches. This patient presents with a diffuse rash that does not show scaly patches.</p>\r\n<p>Although <strong>Rickettsial serolo</strong><strong>gy (RMSF) (Option C)</strong> presents with a diffuse rash, it usually starts at the extremities and progresses towards the trunk before progressing to pruritic papules and petechiae. Unlike in this patient, the face is only rarely involved. This patient does not have typical signs of the disease, such as a history of tick bite, severe headache, malaise, abdominal pain, conjunctivitis, nausea, and/or vomiting, making RMSF an unlikely diagnosis.</p>",
