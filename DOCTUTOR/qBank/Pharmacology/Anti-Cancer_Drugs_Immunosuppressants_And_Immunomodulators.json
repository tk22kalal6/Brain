Because it can take several weeks to months for the therapeutic effect of DMARDs to become evident, agents such as prednisone are needed as \"bridge therapy\" until the DMARDs become effective.</li>\n<li>The major <strong>disadvantage</strong> of using <strong>glucocorticoids</strong> for an extended period is the severe side-effect profile.</li>\n<li><strong>Corticosteroids</strong> affect <strong>calcium and bone metabolism</strong> in a variety of ways.</li>\n<li>For example, these drugs decrease the amount of calcium absorbed by the intestine and also increase calcium excretion through the kidneys, both of which lead to a decreased circulating ionized calcium concentration.</li>\n<li>Furthermore, this process stimulates the parathyroid glands to increase the secretion of parathyroid hormone, which leads to increased bone breakdown, as the body attempts to rectify low circulating calcium levels by releasing calcium from the bones into the blood.</li>\n<li>The <strong>mineralocorticoid effects</strong> of the corticosteroids can result in sodium reabsorption, potassium excretion, and fluid retention. Thus, long-term use of prednisone is associated with <strong>fluid</strong> <strong>retention (not dehydration, Option A ruled out),</strong> <strong>hypokalemia (not hyperkalemia, Option B ruled out)</strong>, and <strong>hypernatremia (not hyponatremia, Option D ruled out)</strong>.</li>\n<li>It should also be noted that electrolyte changes also occur outside the kidney in response to corticosteroid therapy, in the gastrointestinal mucosa, salivary and sweat glands, and exocrine pancreas.</li>\n<li>In the intestine, for example, glucocorticoids can increase sodium and water absorption, as well as potassium secretion.</li>\n<li>Other systemic effects of high doses of glucocorticoids include adrenocortical insufficiency upon glucocorticoid removal, steroid-induced diabetes, resulting in <strong>hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, elevated glucagon, and hypocalcemia</strong></li>\n</ul>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cyclosporine</strong> is indicated for the prevention of renal, cardiac, and liver transplant rejection, as well as the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It may also be effective in patients with <strong>systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's).</strong></li>\n<li>Calcineurin normally stimulates transcription factors that lead to increased production of interleukin 2 and related cytokines. Thus, cyclosporine decreases the production of IL-2.</li>\n<li>Cyclosporine has many drug interactions because the <strong>CYP3A enzyme</strong> system largely metabolizes it; compounds that alter the activity of this enzyme also affect cyclosporine levels. <strong>Grapefruit juice inhibits CYP3A</strong>, resulting in increased blood concentrations of cyclosporine.</li>\n<li>Common<strong> adverse effects</strong> seen with cyclosporine include elevated <strong>BUN, hypertension, tremor, infection, and renal impairment. Serious reactions include severe hypertension, severe hyperkalemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, immunosuppression, nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, seizures, and opportunistic infections.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Azathioprine(Option A):</strong> It's a <strong>prodrug</strong> that converts to <strong>6-mercaptopurine</strong>. Inhibits <strong>purine synthesis</strong>, suppressing both <strong>B and T lymphocyte proliferation. Mainly via xanthine oxidase and thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT). Not metabolized by CYP3A4.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Muromonab-CD3(Options C): </strong>A monoclonal antibody against the CD3 receptor on T-cells. As a monoclonal antibody, it's degraded by proteolysis, not via liver enzymes like CYP450.</p>\n<p><strong>Mycophenolate mofetil(Option D): </strong>Prodrug of mycophenolic acid. Undergoes glucuronidation, not CYP450-mediated.</p>",
