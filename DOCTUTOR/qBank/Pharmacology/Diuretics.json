This increases the risk of metabolic disturbances, but not diuretic failure.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The net effects of vasopressin are mediated by its interaction with the three types of receptors, V1a, V1b, and V2. V2 receptors are primarily located in the principal cells of the renal collecting duct system, as well as on epithelial cells in the thick ascending limb, and on vascular endothelial cells. The drug in this question is blocking vasopressin type 2 (V2) receptors in the collecting duct, because it is increasing the free water clearance (CH20) without affecting sodium or potassium excretion.</li>\n<li>Free water clearance compares the osmolarity of the urine with plasma osmolarity; increased free water clearance occurs when very dilute urine is formed. Since vasopressin has little effect on sodium excretion, vasopressin antagonists tend to increase urine flow without increasing sodium excretion.</li>\n<li>Remember that antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or arginine vasopressin regulates serum osmolarity and blood pressure via the V2 and V1 receptors, respectively. ADH decreases serum osmolarity and increases urine osmolarity via regulation of aquaporin channel transcription in the apical membrane of the principal cells of the distal tubule and collecting ducts, leading to increased water permeability.</li>\n<li>Tolvaptan, for example, acts by selectively antagonising vasopressin V2 receptors, increasing free water excretion. It is indicated for the treatment of both euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia that is symptomatic and resistant to correction with fluid restriction, including patients with heart failure and SIADH.</li>\n<li>Vaptans block the action of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) at renal collecting ducts.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This patient is presenting with signs and symptoms highly suggestive of hypoparathyroidism, a condition that occurs most frequently after thyroidectomy or the removal of a parathyroid adenoma. Hypoparathyroidism is a condition of parathyroid hormone (PTH) deficiency leading to decreased calcium levels and other electrolyte abnormalities.</li>\n<li>Normally, a fall in extracellular fluid ionised calcium concentration leads to stimulation of PTH secretion. When released, PTH enhances active reabsorption of calcium and magnesium from distal tubules and the thick ascending limb in the kidney, enhances the release of calcium from bones and enhances the absorption of calcium in the intestine by increasing the production of activated vitamin D. However, in hypoparathyroidism, PTH levels are greatly reduced, resulting in severe hypocalcemia.</li>\n<li>There are three principal reasons for low Ca2<sup>+</sup>in such cases\n<ul>\n<li>Low PTH reduces renal reabsorption of Ca<sup>++</sup>but increases reabsorption of phosphate.</li>\n<li>The resulting high plasma phosphate binds plasma Ca<sup>++</sup>, so plasma Ca<sup>++</sup> decreases.</li>\n<li>Low PTH causes low production of the active form of vitamin D, so Ca<sup>++</sup>absorption in the small intestine is decreased.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Hypoparathyroidism is characterised by severe hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, resulting in tetany, carpopedal spasms, muscle and abdominal cramps, and tingling of the lips and hands. A positive Chvostek sign (tapping the face in front of the ear elicits tetany) and Trousseau sign (abnormal muscular contractions elicited by applying a blood pressure cuff) will often be noted.</li>\n<li>Since the blood calcium levels are often very low, either calcium gluconate or vitamin D preparations should be administered to correct the condition. Vitamin D preparations, such as Cholecalciferol, elevate calcium levels and also increase phosphate levels. Another treatment option would be to use the vitamin D3 analogue calcitriol. Calcitriol has a mechanism of action similar to that of cholecalciferol. Ergocalciferol is also used, but has a shorter duration and lower potency than cholecalciferol. Although further elevation of serum phosphate would be undesirable, vitamin D analogues are front-line therapy for hypoparathyroidism; phosphate levels may be addressed with phosphate binders or other measures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Bumetanide (Option A): </strong>A loop diuretic that promotes calcium and potassium excretion; worsens hypocalcemia.</p>\n<p><strong>Levothyroxine (Option C): </strong>Replaces thyroid hormone, useful in hypothyroidism, not in managing hypocalcemia due to hypoparathyroidism.</p>\n<p><strong>Metolazone (Option D): </strong>A thiazide-like diuretic that reduces calcium excretion but is not sufficient as a standalone therapy in severe hypocalcemia due to hypoparathyroidism.</p>",

(Remember, one of the primary functions of aldosterone is to increase sodium reabsorption in principal cells of the kidney, which plays a key role in regulating extracellular volume. Aldosterone helps to regulate plasma potassium. The two primary factors that stimulate aldosterone release are plasma angiotensin II and plasma potassium levels.)</li>\n<li>Spironolactone may cause gynecomastia by displacing androgen from the androgen receptor and sexual-hormone-binding globulin, and by causing increased metabolic clearance of testosterone and higher estradiol production.
