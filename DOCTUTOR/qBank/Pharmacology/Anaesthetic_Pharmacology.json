As a result, all volatile agents tend to decrease mean arterial pressure in direct proportion to their alveolar concentration.</li>\n<li>All volatile anaesthetics possess varying degrees of bronchodilating properties, an effect of value in patients with active wheezing and in status asthmatics. However, airway irritation, which may provoke coughing or breath-holding, is induced by the pungency of some volatile anaesthetics. The pungency of isoflurane and desflurane makes these agents less suitable for the induction of anaesthesia in patients with active bronchospasm. These reactions rarely occur with halothane and sevoflurane, which are considered non-pungent.\n<ul>\n<li>Therefore, the bronchodilating action of halothane and sevoflurane makes them the agents of choice in patients with underlying airway problems. Nitrous oxide is also nonpungent and can facilitate inhalational induction of anaesthesia in a patient with bronchospasm.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Inhaled anaesthetics tend to decrease glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and urine flow. Renal blood flow may also be decreased by some agents, but filtration fraction is increased, implying that autoregulatory control of efferent arteriole tone helps compensate and limits the reduction in GFR.</li>\n<li>Volatile anaesthetics cause a concentration-dependent decrease in portal vein blood flow that parallels the decline in cardiac output produced by these agents. However, total hepatic blood flow may be relatively preserved as hepatic artery blood flow to the liver may increase or stay the same. Although transient changes in liver function tests may occur following exposure to volatile anaesthetics, persistent elevation in liver enzymes is rare except following repeated exposures to halothane (see Toxicity of Anaesthetic Agents).\n<ul>\n<li>Nitrous oxide appears to have little effect on uterine musculature. However, the halogenated anaesthetics are potent uterine muscle relaxants and produce this effect in a concentration-dependent fashion. This pharmacologic effect can be helpful when profound uterine relaxation is required for intrauterine fetal manipulation or manual extraction of a retained placenta during delivery. However, it can also lead to increased uterine bleeding.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",
