If monotherapy with anticholinergics is not effective in reducing tremor, they may be given in combination with a dopamine agonist and/or levodopa, as well as MAO-B inhibitors, or replaced altogether.</li>\n<li>Dopamine agonists are a reasonable initial therapy in patients &le; 65 years of age whose symptoms have begun to impact daily function and quality of life (e.g., those with significant bradykinesia or gait disturbance).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Clonazepam(</strong><strong>Option B):</strong> Can be used to treat patients with orthostatic tremor, a condition with an average onset of 60 years of age. Typical clinical features of orthostatic tremor are triggered by longer periods of standing and include leg tremors as well as a sensation of instability. However, the condition only affects the legs and would not be the cause of this patient's hand tremor or reduced arm swing.</p>\n<p><strong>Methimazole(</strong><strong>Option C):</strong> Is used to treat hyperthyroidism with a tremor, that increases with stress, as in this patient, the tremor is usually symmetric and occurs while holding a position against gravity (e.g., extending arms in front of the body). It would also not explain this patient's bradykinesia.</p>\n<p><strong>Propranolol(</strong><strong>Option D):</strong> Is a first-line treatment of benign essential tremor. However, unlike the asymmetric resting tremor seen in this patient, essential tremor is symmetrical, worsen with voluntary movements, and resolves completely at rest.</p>\n<p><strong>The below table gives A list of different drugs used in Parkinson disease and their indications:</strong></p>\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\" https://d3d535v34tlady.cloudfront.net/NEETPGMCQ/20240307987b1c9c-ad75-4cb5-be6e-e5f7eefc7fa6.jpg\">",

There are two types of glutamate receptors: ionotropic (ion channel receptors: AMPA, Kainate, NMDA) and metabotropic (G-protein coupled: mGluR) glutamate receptors.</li>\n<li>The type that is most likely responsible for the excitotoxic effect is the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>NMDA Receptor:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>NMDA receptors are permeable to Ca2+ and Na+. The NMDA receptor is unique because it requires a ligand to activate it (ligand-gated), and it requires depolarisation (voltage-gated) to expel the Mg2+ ion that plugs the channel under resting membrane conditions.</li>\n<li>So, depolarisation may initially occur with stimulation of the AMPA receptor, which allows Na+ ions to enter the cell.</li>\n<li>If there is a sufficient level of depolarisation, then the Mg2+ plug is released from the NMDA receptor, allowing the passage of both Ca2+ and Na+ ions.</li>\n<li>High Ca2+ levels can activate a cascade of cellular degeneration processes, leading to cell death (excitotoxicity) and are thought to play a role in many neurodegenerative diseases.</li>\n<li>On the other hand, activation of the NMDA receptor is also thought to play an important role in the cellular mechanisms involved in synaptic plasticity, such as learning and memory.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, is a dissociative anaesthetic used as a sole anaesthetic for procedures that do not require skeletal relaxation, as an inducing agent, and as an anaesthetic supplement.</li>\n<li>It is also being investigated as a treatment in resistant major depression and as an agent to decrease suicidal thoughts.</li>\n<li>Ketamine is also abused, and street names for it include Special K and Vitamin K. mGluR (which has many subtypes) is an example of a G protein-coupled glutamate receptor.</li>\n<li>Other G protein-coupled receptors include adrenergic and muscarinic receptors. Glutamate is an amino acid and would not bind intracellular receptors such as steroid receptors, which usually act directly in the nucleus as transcription factors.</li>\n</ul>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This patient has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a disorder of the lower motor neurons (located in the ventral horn, producing muscular atrophy and fasciculations), and upper motor neurons (corticospinal neurons, producing hyperreflexia, hypertonia, clasp knife spasticity, and the Babinksi sign). Bulbar involvement may lead to dysarthria and dysphagia.</li>\n<li>Currently there is no cure for ALS and the primary goal of medical care is to provide support and palliative intervention.</li>\n<li>Riluzole is the only agent that has been shown to extend the survival of patients and/or the time until tracheotomy. ALS may involve excitatory toxicity to neurons caused by glutamate. Riluzole is a glutamate release inhibitor and glutamate receptor blocker, as well as a sodium channel blocker.</li>\n<li>The most useful agent for the symptomatic treatment of spasticity of ALS is baclofen <strong>(Option A)</strong>, a GABA-B agonist. However, baclofen does not prolong survival in ALS.</li>\n<li>Clonazepam <strong>(Option B)</strong>, a benzodiazepine, is an effective antispasmodic but may contribute to respiratory depression in patients with advanced ALS. Benzodiazepines increase the frequency of GABA chloride channel opening. It does not prolong survival in ALS.</li>\n<li>Tizanidine <strong>(Option D) </strong>is an agonist of alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the central nervous system and increases presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. Therefore, it can be used to treat spasticity in ALS patients. However, tizanidine does not prolong survival in ALS.</li>\n</ul>",
