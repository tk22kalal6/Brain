So they can be given orally as they have a medium to high Oral: Parenteral potency Ratio, whereas fentanyl has high first-pass metabolism, it has a very low Oral: Parenteral Potency Ratio. So it is better not to give fentanyl orally. <strong>(Options A and B ruled out)</strong></li>\r\n<li>The <strong>transdermal patch </strong>provides stable blood levels of the drug and better pain control while avoiding the need for repeated parenteral injections.</li>\r\n<li>Fentanyl has been the most successful opioid in transdermal application and is indicated for the management of persistent, unremitting pain.</li>\r\n<li>Because of the complication of fentanyl-induced respiratory depression, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that the introduction of a transdermal fentanyl patch (25 mcg/h) be reserved for patients with an established oral morphine requirement of at least 60 mg/d for 1 week or more.</li>\r\n<li>Extreme caution must be exercised in any patient initiating therapy or undergoing a dose increase because the peak effects may not be realised until 24-48 hours after patch application.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Metabolism of Fentanyl:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Hepatic oxidative metabolism is the primary route of degradation of the phenylpiperidine opioids (meperidine, fentanyl, alfentanil, sufentanil) and eventually leaves only small quantities of the parent compound unchanged for excretion.</li>\r\n<li>However, accumulation of a demethylated metabolite of meperidine, normeperidine, may occur in patients with decreased renal function and those receiving multiple high doses of the drug.</li>\r\n<li>In high concentrations, normeperidine may cause seizures. In contrast, no active metabolites of fentanyl have been reported. The P450 isozyme CYP3A4 metabolises fentanyl by N-dealkylation in the liver.</li>\r\n<li>CYP3A4 is also present in the mucosa of the small intestine and contributes to the first-pass metabolism of fentanyl when it is taken orally.</li>\r\n<li>Codeine, oxycodone, and hydrocodone undergo metabolism in the liver by P450 isozyme CYP2D6, resulting in the production of metabolites of greater potency.</li>\r\n</ul>",

In this regard, when analgesic tolerance or intolerable side effects have developed with the use of increasing doses of morphine or hydromorphone, \"opioid rotation\" to methadone has provided superior analgesia at 10-20% of the morphine-equivalent daily dose.</li>\n<li>In contrast to its use in suppressing symptoms of opioid withdrawal, use of methadone as an analgesic typically requires administration at intervals of no more than 8 hours. However, given methadone's highly variable pharmacokinetics and long half-life (25-52 hours), initial administration should be closely monitored to avoid potentially harmful adverse effects, especially respiratory depression. Because methadone is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 isoforms in the liver, inhibition of its metabolic pathway or hepatic dysfunction has also been associated with overdose effects, including respiratory depression or, more rarely, prolonged QT-based cardiac arrhythmias.</li>\n</ul>",
