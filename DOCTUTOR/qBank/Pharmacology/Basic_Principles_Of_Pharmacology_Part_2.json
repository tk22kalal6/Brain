This would result in a <strong>lower AUC for oral administration</strong> compared to intravenous administration, even after dose correction.</p>\n<p><strong>Low volume of distribution (Option C):</strong> The volume of distribution (Vd) refers to the extent to which a drug distributes into tissues relative to the plasma. It has no direct impact on the <strong>AUC differences between routes of administration</strong>, especially when the question is focused on absorption and systemic availability.</p>\n<p><strong>Delayed clearance (Option D):</strong> Delayed or decreased clearance means the drug is eliminated more slowly from the body, which could lead to higher plasma concentrations over time. However, clearance affects <strong>drug elimination</strong>, not <strong>bioavailability</strong>, and cannot explain why the oral and IV AUCs would be equivalent.</p>",

It is not metabolised by the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme system, including CYP3A4. Therefore, grapefruit juice does not affect its pharmacokinetics.</p>\n<p><strong>Aspirin (Option B): </strong>Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is hydrolysed by esterases in the plasma and liver to form salicylic acid. It does not undergo significant metabolism via CYP3A4 or other CYP450 isoforms. Thus, grapefruit juice does not affect aspirin's metabolism or toxicity.</p>\n<p><strong>Sildenafil (Option D): </strong>Sildenafil is metabolised predominantly by CYP3A4, with a minor contribution from CYP2C9. Grapefruit juice can theoretically increase sildenafil plasma concentration. However, the clinical significance is modest at therapeutic doses. While caution is advised, it is not routinely contraindicated with grapefruit juice, unlike atorvastatin</p>",

Hence, <strong>hepatic impairment (cirrhosis)</strong> does <strong>not</strong> warrant a dose reduction.</li>\n<li>Dose adjustment should instead be based on <strong>renal function.</strong></li>\n<li>Although <strong>meperidine</strong> is primarily metabolised by the <strong>liver</strong>, its <strong>toxic metabolite normeperidine</strong> is <strong>renally excreted</strong>. In renal impairment, normeperidine can accumulate and cause <strong>CNS toxicity</strong> (tremors, seizures). Therefore, <strong>dose reduction in renal disease is necessary</strong>. <strong>(Option B) </strong></li>\n<li><strong>Diazepam</strong> is metabolised in the liver and has a <strong>long half-life</strong>. In elderly patients, even those with normal hepatic/renal labs, <strong>increased sensitivity</strong> and <strong>altered pharmacokinetics</strong> (due to fat redistribution and reduced clearance) necessitate dose adjustment. <strong>(Option C)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Cirrhosis impairs hepatic metabolism</strong>, leading to <strong>reduced clearance</strong> of meperidine. Additionally, <strong>altered hepatic blood flow</strong> can increase the drug&rsquo;s <strong>plasma concentration</strong>, justifying a dose reduction in cirrhotic patients. <strong>(Option D)</strong></li>\n</ul>",
