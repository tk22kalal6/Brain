This statement accurately describes the disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Bulla spread sign is negative (Option D):<br /></strong>The <strong>bulla spread sign</strong> (also called <strong>Lutz sign</strong>) refers to the lateral extension of a blister upon applying pressure to its edge. In bullous pemphigoid, this sign is typically <strong>negative</strong>, as the bulla walls are strong and the blister does not spread easily.
