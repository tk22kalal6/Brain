It&rsquo;s common to see multiple family members affected, as indicated by the presence of the disease in both the patient's mother and brother.</p>\n<p>Button hole sign: This sign refers to the ability to invaginate a neurofibroma by applying pressure with the tip of the index finger, causing it to push back into the subcutaneous tissue. Once the pressure is released, the neurofibroma reappears on the skin surface, as the lesion is soft and mobile.</p>\n<p>The primary skin manifestations of Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cafe-au-lait macules</strong>: These are well-defined, light brown patches that are typically the earliest cutaneous manifestation of NF1.

(Option B ruled out)</li>\n<li><strong>Cutaneous neurofibromas</strong>: These are soft, lilac-pink tumours, sessile and dome shaped, and sometimes pedunculated. They are derived from peripheral nerves and their supporting structures, including neurilemmal cells.</li>\n<li><strong>Plexiform neurofibromas</strong>: These are diffuse, elongated fibromas along the course of a nerve, frequently involving the trigeminal or upper cervical nerves.They have a distinctive &lsquo;bag of worms&rsquo; feeling on palpation</li>\n<li><strong>Lisch nodules</strong>: These are pigmented hamartomas of the iris, that appear as dome-shaped lesions on the iris, detectable by slit-lamp examination.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Pseudoarthrosis of long bones is seen (Option C): </strong>Pseudoarthrosis, especially of the tibia, is a recognized skeletal complication of NF1.</p>",
