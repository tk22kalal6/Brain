Other underlying causes include gastro-intestinal malabsorption, vitamin D deficiency, liver disease or chronic lithium usage.</li>\n<li>The pathogenesis of secondary hyperparathyroidism is related to renal dysfunction. Abnormalities in the renal tubular absorption of phosphate lead to hyperphosphataemia. This acts directly on the parathyroid cells and stimulates PTH secretion.</li>\n<li>More recent translational research has identified a novel phosphaturia hormone, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF 23). This is progressively secreted from osteocytes to compensate for chronic phosphate retention that in turn leads to a reduction in 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D, which by reducing the intestinal absorption of calcium, also acts to increase secretion of PTH.</li>\n<li>Previous studies in patients with chronic renal disease have shown that there is a reduction in the expression of the vitamin D receptor and the CaR, with associated skeletal resistance to PTH.</li>\n<li>These factors interact to form the complex pattern leading to progressive secondary hyperparathyroidism in the setting of chronic renal disease.</li>\n<li>The pathological characteristics associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism include hyperplasia, <strong>asymmetrical glandular enlargement or nodularity.</strong></li>\n<li>This differentiation is important, as when the parathyroid gland becomes nodular it loses expression of the vitamin D and Ca receptors. It has been proposed that nodular parathyroid glands may be resistant to calcimimetics and therefore be refractory to medical management.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Reference</strong>: Bailey &amp; Love's short practice of surgery 28<sup>th</sup> Edition, CHAPTER 56, The parathyroid glands, Pg:884.</p>",

      "solution": "<ul>\n<li>Other conditions that occur within MEN2A include cutaneous lichen amyloidosis and Hirschsprung disease.</li>\n<li>Cutaneous lichen amyloidosis is uncommon and typically occurs with codon 634 mutations. It is characterized by the symptom of pruritus and it is thought that repeated scratching then leads to amyloid deposition in the papillary dermis of the skin. As a result, patients develop cutaneous plaques, often located on the back.</li>\n<li>Hirschsprung disease may also occur in patients with either MEN2A or FMTC.</li>\n<li>MEN2A is the most common subtype of the MEN2 syndromes, comprising the majority of cases.</li>\n<li>The hallmark characteristic of MEN2A is the development of MTC, with a greater than 90% penetrance.</li>\n<li>In addition to MTC, pheochromocytoma develops in 50% to 60% of patients and PHPT in up to 30% with both adrenal glands and all parathyroid glands at risk.</li>\n<li>The degree of penetrance of each tumor type is associated with specific codon mutations, and all patients are at risk for the development of multiple tumors within each endocrine organ, including multifocal MTC.</li>\n<li>Patients with MEN2A have a normal physical appearance and body habitus, unlike those with MEN2B that are associated with a Marfanoid habitus and neurofibromas of the tongue.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Reference</strong>: Sabinston Textbook of Surgery 21<sup>st</sup> Edition, SECTION VIII ENDOCRINE, Chapter 41, The Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Syndromes, Pg: 1005.</p>",
