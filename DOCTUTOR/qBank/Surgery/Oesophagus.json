      "solution": "<p>Surgical anatomy</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The oesophagus is a muscular tube, approximately 25 cm long, mainly occupying the posterior mediastinum and extending from the upper oesophageal sphincter (the cricopharyngeus muscle) in the neck to the junction with the cardia of the stomach.</li>\n<li>The musculature of the upper oesophagus, including the upper sphincter, is striated. This is followed by a transitional zone of both striated and smooth muscle with the proportion of the latter progressively increasing so that, in the lower half of the oesophagus, there is only smooth muscle.</li>\n<li>It is lined throughout with squamous epithelium.</li>\n<li>The parasympathetic nerve supply is mediated by branches of the vagus nerve that has synaptic connections to the myenteric (Auerbach's) plexus. Meissner's submucosal plexus is sparse in the oesophagus.</li></ul><p>In the neck, it descends behind the trachea and anteriorly to the vertebral column following its curvature into the thorax. At the lower part of the thoracic cavity, it transverses the diaphragmatic hiatus, clasped by the crura of the diaphragm and into the stomach. There are slight curvatures of the oesophagus; in the neck, it leans slightly more towards the left side, while in the mid-chest it curves slightly towards the right and in the lower part of the thorax edges to the left again. Thus, in the neck exposure of the cervical oesophagus is generally easier from the left side. The recurrent laryngeal nerves lie in the tracheo-oesophageal grooves. On the right side, the recurrent laryngeal nerve at the lower neck is often at a small distance from the tracheooesophageal groove, while on the left side the nerve is <strong>opposed</strong> closely to the oesophagus and trachea. This is an important anatomical detail when exposing the oesophagus and when cervical lymphadenectomy is performed.</p>\n<p><strong>Reference</strong>: Bailey &amp; Love's short practice of surgery, chapter: 66, Edition: 28th, Pg: 1106</p>",

They self-medicate with over-the-counter medicines such as simple antacids, antacid-alginate preparations, H2-receptor antagonists or PPIs.</li>\n<li>Consultation is more likely when symptoms are severe, prolonged and unresponsive to the above treatments.</li>\n<li>Simple measures that are often neglected include advice about weight loss, smoking, excessive consumption of alcohol, tea or coffee, the avoidance of large meals late at night and a modest degree of head-up tilt of the bed. Tilting the bed has been shown to have an effect that is similar to taking an H2-receptor antagonist. The common practice of using additional pillows has no significant effect.</li>\n<li>PPIs are the most effective drug treatment for GORD. Indeed, they are so effective that, once started, patients are very reluctant to stop taking them. Given an adequate dose for 8 weeks, most patients have a rapid improvement in symptoms (within a few days), and more than 90% can expect full mucosal healing at the end of this time</li>\n<li>As most patients do not make major lifestyle changes and as PPIs are so effective, many remain on long-term treatment. For the minority who do not respond adequately to a standard dose, a trial at an increased dose or the addition of an H2-receptor antagonist is recommended. If unsuccessful, these patients should be formally investigated.</li>\n<li>PPI therapy is also important in patients with reflux induced strictures, resulting in significant prolongation of the intervals between endoscopic dilatation. As yet, fears that chronic acid suppression might have serious long-term side effects including the risk of gastric cancer seem unwarranted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Reference:</strong> Bailey &amp; Love's short practice of surgery, chapter: 66, Edition: 28th, Pg: 1115</p>",

      "solution": "<p>SURGERY</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Histological tumour type, location and the extent of the proposed lymphadenectomy all influence the surgical approach. This is largely an issue of surgical preference, although it should be recognised that a left thoracoabdominal approach is limited proximally by the aortic arch and should be avoided when the primary tumour is at or above this level.</li>\r\n<li>Similarly, transhiatal oesophagectomy is unsuitable for most patients with squamous cell carcinoma because a complete mediastinal lymphadenectomy is not easily achieved by this approach.</li>\r\n<li>The most widely practised approach in the west is the two-phase Ivor Lewis (sometimes called Lewis-Tanner) operation with an initial laparotomy and construction of a gastric tube, followed by a right thoracotomy to excise the tumour and create an oesophagogastric anastomosis. The closer this is placed to the apex of the thoracic cavity, the fewer problems there are with reflux disease.</li>\r\n<li>Three-phase oesophagectomy (McKeown) may be more appropriate for more proximal tumours in order to achieve better longitudinal clearance, although the additional distance gained is less than many surgeons believe. A third cervical incision also permits lymphadenectomy in this region.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>TWO-PHASE OESOPHAGECTOMY (ABDOMEN AND RIGHT CHEST, IVOR LEWIS)</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Mobilisation of the stomach must be done with care because it is essential to have a tension-free, well-vascularised stomach for transposition.</li>\r\n<li>The left gastric, short gastric and left gastroepiploic arteries are all divided. The viability of the transposed stomach mainly depends on the right gastroepiploic and, to a lesser extent, the right gastric vessels.</li>\r\n<li>It should be noted that venous drainage is as important as arterial supply, and it is essential to perform an accurate anatomical dissection that preserves the right gastroepiploic vein as well as the artery. The stomach is divided to remove the cardia and the upper part of the lesser curve, including the whole of the left gastric artery and its associated lymph nodes.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>TRANSHIATAL OESOPHAGECTOMY (WITHOUT THORACOTOMY)</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>This approach was popularised for cancer by Orringer, adapting a technique developed in Brazil by Pinotti for the removal of chagasic megaoesophagus.</li>\r\n<li>The stomach is mobilised through a midline abdominal incision or by laparoscopy, and the cervical oesophagus is mobilised through an incision in the neck.</li>\r\n<li>The diaphragm is then opened from the abdomen, and the posterior mediastinum is entered. The lower oesophagus and the tumour are mobilised under direct vision, and the upper oesophagus is mobilised by blunt dissection. This approach can provide an adequate removal of the tumour and lymph nodes in the lower mediastinum, but it is not possible to remove the nodes in the middle or upper mediastinum.</li>\r\n<li>It may be a useful procedure for lesions of the lower oesophagus, but is hazardous for a middle third lesion that may be adherent to the bronchus or to the azygos vein.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Reference</strong>: Bailey &amp; Love's short practice of surgery, chapter: 66, Edition: 28th, Pg: 1141</p>",
