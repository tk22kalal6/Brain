The heart does not eject and is relatively still but not bloodless. The aorta is cross-clamped to render the heart ischaemic. The heart can tolerate short periods (10-20 min) of ischaemia, provided the heart is reperfused when the cross-clamp is released and allowed to beat following cardioversion for short periods during the operation.</li>\n<li>Total circulatory arrest becomes necessary when visibility and clarity of the operative area is crucial, as in paediatric surgery or in surgery of the ascending aorta and arch of the aorta. CPB is instituted and the core body temperature reduced to 15-18&deg;C (profound hypothermia). The metabolic rate of all organs of the body is reduced by 50% with every 7&deg;C drop in temperature. Using this technique, circulatory arrest can be tolerated for up to 20-30 min.
