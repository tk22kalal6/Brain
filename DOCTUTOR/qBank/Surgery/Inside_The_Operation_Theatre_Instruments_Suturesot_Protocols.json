      "solution": "<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Goligher retractor</strong>. This is a self-retaining retractor used in operations on the sigmoid colon and rectum, such as anterior resection and upper end of abdominoperineal resection.</li>\r\n<li>Once the abdomen has been opened and laparotomy performed, the patient is placed head down and all the small bowel is packed to the upper end of the abdomen.</li>\r\n<li>The retractor is then inserted with the side blades to separate the edges of the abdominal wall.</li>\r\n<li>The central blade is then inserted to keep the small bowel well tucked away from the operation site.</li>\r\n<li>All three blades come in different widths to fit in with the patient's build. John Cedric</li>\r\n<li>Goligher (1912-1998), Ulsterman by birth, Professor of Surgery at Leeds, his contributions to colorectal surgery in the world have been legendary.</li>\r\n<li>His operating theatres at Leeds General Infirmary 'have been the Mecca for surgeons from all over the world'.</li>\r\n<li>His book, <em>Surgery of the Anus, Rectum and Colon</em>, was regarded as the ultimate authority on the subject and had five editions.</li>\r\n<li><strong>St Mark's perineal retractor</strong>. This is used for the perineal part of an abdominoperineal resection.</li>\r\n<li>After making the perineal incision and adequate dissection of the perineal wound, the retractor is inserted.</li>\r\n<li>As the dissection proceeds, the retractor has to be repositioned. The pointed ends are directed towards the front.</li>\r\n<li>St Mark's Hospital, Harrow, UK, is recognised as a national and international referral centre for intestinal and colorectal disorders.</li>\r\n<li>It was founded in a small room in No. 11 Aldersgate Street. Established in 1854 on City Road in Hackney as St Mark's Hospital for Fistula and other Diseases of the Rectum.</li>\r\n<li>It was so named as it was opened on St Mark's Day, 25 April. In 1994, it moved to its present site in Harrow.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Travers retractor</strong>. This is a self-retaining retractor used for intermediate-type operations, such as heriorrhaphy, groin dissection for varicose veins and femoral embolectomy.</li>\r\n<li>It retracts skin and subcutaneous tissues; as the incision is deepened, the retractor has to be repositioned.

These lines represent the orientation of the dermal collagen fibres and any incision placed parallel to these lines results in a better scar.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2 Anatomical structure</strong>. Incisions should avoid bony prominences and crossing skin creases if possible, and take into consideration underlying structures, such as nerves and vessels.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3 Cosmetic factors</strong>. Any incision should be made bearing in mind the ultimate cosmetic result, especially in exposed parts of the body, as an incision is the only part of the operation the patient sees.</p>\r\n<p><strong>4 Adequate access for the procedure</strong>. The incision must be functionally effective for the procedure in hand because any compromise purely on cosmetic grounds may render the operation ineffective or even dangerous.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Reference:</strong> Love &amp; Bailey short practice of surgery, chapter: 7, Edition: 27th, Pg: 85</p>",

      "solution": "<ul>\r\n<li>Drains put in to cover perioperative bleeding may usually be removed after 24 hours, e.g. thyroidectomy.</li>\r\n<li>Drains put in to drain serous collections usually can be removed after 5 days, e.g. mastectomy.</li>\r\n<li>Drains put in because of infection should be left until the infection is subsiding or the drainage is minimal.</li>\r\n<li>Drains put in to cover colorectal anastomoses should be removed at about 5-7 days. However, it should be stressed that in no way does a drain prevent any intestinal leakage, but merely may assist any such leakage to drain externally rather than to produce life-threatening peritonitis.</li>\r\n<li>Common bile duct T-tubes should remain in for 10 days. However, once the T-tube cholangiogram has shown that there is free flow of bile into the duodenum and that there are no retained stones, some surgeons like to clamp the T-tube prior to removal. The 10-day period is required to minimise the risk of biliary peritonitis after removal. T-tubes are traditionally and intentionally made of latex to stimulate fibrosis, which results in the formation of a tract to allow the drainage of bile if required. It is important to use an alternative to latex if the patient is allergic, bearing in mind the decreased potential for fibrosis of silicone- based T-tubes. The increase in less invasive means of intervention for bile duct pathology has resulted in fewer T-tubes being used.</li>\r\n<li>Any suction drain should have the suction taken off prior to removal of the drain. Even in the absence of suction, a blocked drain may be difficult to remove owing to the creation of a relative vacuum as it is pulled out. This can be released by twisting the drain on removal or flushing with a small volume of sterile saline under aseptic conditions.</li>\r\n<li>During removal of a chest drain, the patient should be asked to breathe in and hold their breath, thus doing a Valsalva manoeuvre. In this way, no air is sucked into the pleural cavity as the tube is removed. Once the drain is out, a previously inserted purse-string suture should be tied.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Reference</strong>: Love &amp; Bailey short practice of surgery, chapter: 7, Edition: 27<sup>th</sup>, Pg: 101</p>",
