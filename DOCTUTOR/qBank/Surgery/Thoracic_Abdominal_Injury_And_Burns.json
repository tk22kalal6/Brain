      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Silver sulphadiazine and cerium nitrate</strong> combination is a useful topical agent, especially for full-thickness burns. Cerium nitrate forms a <strong>sterile eschar</strong> on the burned skin and has been shown to reduce <strong>cell-mediated immunosuppression</strong> that occurs after burns, particularly in elderly patients. This agent not only provides antimicrobial protection but also <strong>boosts cell-mediated immunity</strong>, an important factor in burn wound healing and prevention of systemic infections.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1% silver sulphadiazine cream (Option A) </strong>offers <strong>broad-spectrum antibacterial prophylaxis, </strong>effective against <strong><em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em></strong><strong> and methicillin-resistant </strong><strong><em>Staphylococcus aureus,</em></strong> but does not reduce immunosuppression.</p>\n<p><strong>0.5% silver nitrate solution (Option B)</strong> is effective as <strong>prophylaxis against </strong><strong><em>Pseudomonas</em></strong><strong> colonization</strong> but <strong>less active against some gram-negative aerobes </strong>compared to silver sulphadiazine. Requires <strong>reapplication every 2-4 hours</strong> due to washout and causes black staining of surrounding materials. No immunomodulatory effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Mafenide acetate cream (Option C) </strong>is commonly used in the US as a <strong>5% topical solution</strong>. It is effective against many burn wound pathogens but is <strong>painful to apply</strong> and has been associated with <strong>metabolic acidosis</strong>. It does <strong>not reduce immunosuppression</strong>.</p>",
