Many under-fives present with a perforated appendix, not because the diagnosis is made late but rather because the omentum is less well developed and inflammation is not well contained.</li>\r\n<li>The treatment starts with resuscitation with intravenous fluids, analgesia and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Appendicectomy can be performed laparoscopically or through a muscle splitting right iliac fossa incision.
