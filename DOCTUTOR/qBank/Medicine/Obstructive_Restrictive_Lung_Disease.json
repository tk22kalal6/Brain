Key PFT changes include increased residual volume (RV) and total lung capacity (TLC) due to air trapping, while tidal volume (VT) often remains relatively normal. FEV1 is markedly reduced, and FEV1/FVC ratio is decreased.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Restrictive lung disease</strong> (e.g., pulmonary fibrosis, interstitial lung disease) is characterized by decreased lung compliance and reduced lung volumes. TLC, vital capacity (VC), and residual volume are reduced. VT may remain near normal as patients adapt by increasing breathing frequency rather than depth. FEV1 and FVC are reduced proportionally, so FEV1/FVC ratio is normal or slightly increased.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Key point</strong>: Tidal volume, which represents the volume of air exchanged during quiet breathing, is usually preserved in both conditions, unlike residual volume, total lung capacity, or FEV1/FVC ratio, which show disease-specific changes.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Explanation of incorrect options</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Residual volume (Option A):</strong> Increased in obstructive disease due to air trapping, decreased or normal in restrictive disease.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Total lung capacity (Option C):</strong> Increased in obstructive disease (hyperinflation) and decreased in restrictive disease.</p>\r\n<p><strong>FEV1/FVC ratio (Option D):</strong> Decreased in obstructive disease, normal or increased in restrictive disease; changes are not similar between the two.</p>",
