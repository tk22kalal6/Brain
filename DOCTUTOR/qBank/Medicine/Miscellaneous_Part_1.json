It can cause <strong>dose-dependent myelotoxicity</strong>, resulting in <strong>pancytopenia or isolated cytopenias</strong> (e.g., leukopenia, anemia). This patient's <strong>low WCC and Hb</strong> are consistent with this side effect. <strong>Bone marrow suppression</strong> leads to increased susceptibility to infections - explaining the <strong>cough and fever</strong> -which are likely <strong>secondary</strong> to immunosuppression rather than primary causes themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Incorrect Options: </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Pneumonia (Option A):</strong> While the patient has <strong>fever and cough</strong>, pneumonia <strong>does not cause cytopenias</strong> like leukopenia and anemia. In this context, it is more likely a <strong>consequence of immunosuppression</strong> than the primary cause of the blood abnormalities.</p>\n<p><strong>Prednisolone (Option B):</strong> Corticosteroids generally cause <strong>leukocytosis (elevated WCC)</strong> due to demargination of neutrophils, not leukopenia. They can contribute to immunosuppression but are <strong>not myelotoxic</strong> like azathioprine.</p>\n<p><strong>Low EPO (Option C):</strong> Low erythropoietin (EPO) may contribute to <strong>anemia</strong> in chronic kidney disease, but it <strong>does not explain the leukopenia</strong> or the acute presentation with fever and cough.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>The diagnosis is <strong>Pyelonephritis</strong> - an upper urinary tract infection involving the renal pelvis and kidney parenchyma. In this case, the diagnosis is supported by the presence of <strong>acute graft site pain</strong> 4 months post-transplant and <strong>positive nitrites</strong> on urinalysis. <strong>Nitrites</strong> are produced when <strong>Gram-negative bacteria</strong>, particularly <em>E. coli</em>, convert nitrates to nitrites in the urine - making it a strong indicator of a <strong>bacterial UTI</strong>. Although the urinalysis does not show leukocytes or blood, immunosuppressed patients (such as transplant recipients) and diabetics may not mount a full inflammatory response, and sterile pyuria or absence of leukocyturia is possible. The presence of <strong>proteinuria</strong> can also be seen in infections involving the upper urinary tract.</p>\n<p><strong>Nephrolithiasis (Option A):<br /> </strong>Nephrolithiasis typically presents with <strong>severe, colicky flank or groin pain</strong>, often accompanied by <strong>hematuria</strong>. Nitrites are not produced by stones themselves, though they may appear if a stone is secondarily infected - which would also show <strong>leukocytes</strong> or</p>\n<p><strong>pyuria</strong>, usually present in such cases. The absence of hematuria and the presence of nitrites without leukocytes makes this diagnosis less likely.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Incorrect Options: </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Graft rejection (Option C):<br /> </strong>Graft rejection can present with <strong>graft tenderness</strong>, <strong>fever</strong>, and <strong>declining renal function</strong> but is <strong>not associated with nitrite positivity</strong>, as rejection is not infectious in nature. The lack of blood, pyuria, or rising creatinine, and the presence of nitrites, argue against acute rejection as the primary diagnosis here.</p>\n<p><strong>Diabetic nephropathy (Option D):<br /> </strong>Diabetic nephropathy is a <strong>chronic</strong> condition leading to <strong>progressive proteinuria</strong> and renal function decline. It does not cause <strong>acute pain</strong> or <strong>positive nitrites</strong> and is not typically a concern only 4 months after transplant in a patient with a functioning graft.</p>",

In adults, it may first be recognized due to <strong>chronic kidney disease (CKD)</strong> or <strong>hypertension</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Renal ultrasound</strong> is the safest and most accessible initial investigation in a patient with <strong>renal impairment</strong>, particularly when serum creatinine is significantly elevated. It can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Detect <strong>small, irregular, scarred kidneys</strong> (classic for reflux nephropathy)</li>\n<li>Identify <strong>asymmetry</strong> in renal size or cortical thinning</li>\n<li>Avoid <strong>nephrotoxic contrast agents</strong>, which are contraindicated when creatinine is high</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Incorrect Options: </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Intravenous urography (Option A):<br /> </strong>Uses iodinated contrast and is <strong>contraindicated in significant renal dysfunction</strong> (creatinine 3.3 mg/dL).

It exposes the patient to <strong>radiation</strong> and possibly <strong>contrast</strong>, which should be avoided in renal impairment. Non-contrast CT is more useful for stones, not for evaluating reflux damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Isotopic imaging with 99mTc-DTPA (Option C):<br /> </strong>Used primarily for <strong>renal perfusion and function</strong> assessment, but <strong>DTPA is filtered by glomeruli</strong> and may not give accurate results when GFR is low. For detecting scarring and reflux-related damage, <strong>99mTc-DMSA</strong> would be better-not DTPA. So this is <strong>not the correct tracer for reflux nephropathy</strong>.</p>",
