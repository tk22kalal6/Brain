These features together are highly suggestive of <strong>renal-cell carcinoma (RCC)</strong>. RCC often presents subtly and may be incidentally detected, but classic features include haematuria, flank mass, and systemic symptoms. The elevated ESR reflects inflammation, and hypercalcemia can result from a paraneoplastic syndrome-commonly due to secretion of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP). A varicocele, particularly if right-sided or of recent onset, may indicate obstruction of the gonadal vein by a retroperitoneal mass such as RCC. This collection of findings aligns well with renal-cell carcinoma, making it the most appropriate diagnosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Incorrect Options: </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Transitional-cell carcinoma (Option A):</strong></p>\n<p>Transitional-cell carcinoma affects the renal pelvis, ureters, and bladder, and can cause hematuria.

It is exceedingly rare in adults, and a diagnosis in a 68-year-old would be highly unlikely. Therefore, this option is not appropriate.</p>\n<p><strong>Retroperitoneal sarcoma (Option C):</strong></p>\n<p>Retroperitoneal sarcomas can cause mass effect and potentially compress structures like the gonadal vein, leading to varicocele. However, they do not typically cause haematuria or hypercalcemia, and are far less common than RCC. The absence of direct renal involvement also makes this less likely.</p>",

It involves the <strong>injection of iodinated contrast dye</strong> into a vein, which is then filtered by the kidneys and visualized using X-rays.</p>\n<p>The most significant <strong>severe complication</strong> associated with IVU is <strong>hypersensitivity to the contrast dye</strong>. This can range from mild allergic reactions (e.g., rash, urticaria) to <strong>severe anaphylactic reactions</strong>, which are rare but potentially life-threatening. Therefore, patients should be <strong>screened for any history of contrast allergies or asthma</strong>, and informed consent should include discussion of this risk.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Incorrect Options: </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ureter damage (Option B):</strong></p>\n<p>This is not a risk associated with intravenous urography, since the contrast is injected into a <strong>vein</strong>, not directly into the ureters.

The major concern remains systemic contrast hypersensitivity.</p>\n<p><strong>Bleeding (Option D):</strong></p>\n<p>Bleeding is not a recognized complication of intravenous urography, as the procedure does not involve incisions or instrumentation of blood vessels beyond venipuncture, which is very low risk.</p>",

Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects autonomic as well as somatic nervous system functions.

A <strong>distended bladder with bilateral hydroureteronephrosis</strong> points to <strong>chronic lower urinary tract obstruction</strong>, with back-pressure effects on the upper urinary tract, leading to post-renal AKI.</p>\n<p>Thus, the <strong>most likely cause</strong> of obstructive renal failure in this context is <strong>neurogenic bladder secondary to Parkinson's disease</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Incorrect Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Benign prostatic hypertrophy (Option A):</strong></p>\n<p>Although common in elderly men, BPH would not explain the full constellation of findings as clearly as neurogenic bladder in a Parkinson's patient.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>This patient is on <strong>acetazolamide</strong>, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor commonly used for glaucoma. Carbonic anhydrase plays a key role in bicarbonate reabsorption in the <strong>proximal tubule</strong> of the nephron.</p>\n<p>When inhibited, there is decreased reabsorption of bicarbonate and increased excretion of bicarbonate in the urine. This leads to a <strong>loss of base</strong>, resulting in a <strong>metabolic acidosis</strong>. Because bicarbonate is lost without the generation of organic acids, the <strong>anion gap remains normal</strong>.</p>\n<p>To maintain electroneutrality, the kidney retains chloride, leading to a <strong>hyperchloremic (normal anion gap) metabolic acidosis</strong>. Her blood gas and chemistry findings - low bicarbonate (15 mmol/L), low pH (7.26), low pCO<sub>2</sub> (21.7 mmHg), elevated chloride (115 mmol/L), and normal sodium - support this diagnosis.</p>\n<p>Explanation of Incorrect Options:</p>\n<p><strong>Ketoacidosis (Option B):</strong></p>\n<p>Ketoacidosis, typically seen in uncontrolled diabetes or prolonged fasting, causes a <strong>high anion gap metabolic acidosis</strong>due to accumulation of ketone bodies (acetoacetate, &beta;-hydroxybutyrate).

Additionally, she is asymptomatic and has no mention of elevated glucose, dehydration, or ketones.</p>\n<p><strong>Metformin-induced lactic acidosis (Option C):</strong></p>\n<p>Lactic acidosis due to metformin use is also a <strong>high anion gap metabolic acidosis</strong>, as lactate accumulation increases the anion gap. It usually occurs in the setting of renal impairment or hypoperfusion and is typically symptomatic.
