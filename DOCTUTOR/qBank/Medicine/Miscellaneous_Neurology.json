Very high lesions, such as those from axillary compression (e.g., \"Saturday night palsy\" or \"crutch palsy\"), involve wrist and hand weakness along with paralysis of the triceps and loss of the triceps reflex.</p>\n<p><strong>Anterior interosseous nerve (Option C): </strong>Anterior interosseous nerve injury presents with <strong>pure motor weakness</strong>, classically causing inability to make the '<strong>OK sign</strong>' due to flexor pollicis longus and flexor digitorum profundus weakness, without any sensory loss.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>The given clinical scenario of recurrent fevers with chills with history of travel to West Africa points to a diagnosis of <strong>Plasmodium ovale</strong> malaria.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Malaria</strong> is a protozoan disease transmitted by female Anopheles mosquitoes, primarily affecting tropical regions. It is caused by Plasmodium species and remains a major global health concern.</li>\n<li>The main species of Plasmodium which cause infection in humans are P.falciparum, P.malariae, P.vivax, P.ovale, and P.knowlesii.</li>\n<li>ovale is commonly found in <strong>Africa</strong>, due to its ability to infect only non-Duffy blood group individuals as people there are duffy negative.</li>\n<li>vivax and P.ovale have <strong>liver hypnozoite</strong>s in their life cycle which causes <strong>relapses</strong>.Initial symptoms are nonspecific, including fever, malaise, headache, fatigue, and muscle aches. Classic malarial paroxysms (fever, chills, rigors) with irregular fever patterns are common.</li>\n<li>Severe features may include seizures in children, anemia, jaundice, and splenomegaly, especially in areas of unstable transmission.</li>\n<li>Definitive diagnosis is by identifying<strong> asexual Plasmodium forms</strong> in stained peripheral blood smears (thick and thin).</li>\n<li><strong>Giemsa stain</strong> is preferred, and rapid diagnostic tests like HRP2-based assays are also used. Additional lab findings may show anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, raised bilirubin, and elevated inflammatory markers in severe disease.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options: </strong></p>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: upper-alpha;\">\n<li><strong> Visceral leishmaniasis: </strong>The most frequent clinical manifestation of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is the <strong>sudden onset</strong> of moderate to high fever accompanied by chills and rigors. The fever may <strong>persist for several weeks</strong>, gradually lessening in severity, sometimes followed by a brief afebrile phase before recurring. <strong>Splenic enlargement</strong> typically becomes detectable by the <strong>second week </strong>and can become massive as the illness progresses. This is usually followed by moderate enlargement of the liver.</li>\n<li><strong> Brucellosis: </strong>Brucellosis is a zoonosis transmitted directly or indirectly from infected animals. The incubation period of brucellosis is usually one to three weeks, but sometimes may be several months. If left untreated it results in a characteristic <strong>undulating fever</strong>. Other features include night sweats, fatigue, and musculoskeletal symptoms.</li>\n<li><strong>Plasmodium falciparum malaria: </strong>The clinical history of recurrent episodes of fever rules out this option since P.falciparum does not have liver hypnozoites in its lifecycle.</li>\n</ol>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>The most likely diagnosis based on the clinical features of non-specific <strong>abdominal pain</strong>, anxiety, and history of using oral contraceptive pills is <strong>acute intermittent porphyria</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Porphyrias</strong> are metabolic conditions stemming from either a deficiency or overactivity of specific enzymes within the<strong> heme biosynthetic pathway</strong>.</li>\n<li>These disorders may be inherited in autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked patterns, except for porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), which often occurs sporadically.</li>\n<li>Based on the primary site of porphyrin precursor accumulation, porphyrias are categorized as <strong>hepatic</strong> or <strong>erythropoietic</strong>, and further classified as acute or cutaneous based on clinical manifestations.</li>\n<li>Hepatic porphyrias primarily affect the liver and typically present with <strong>neurologic symptoms</strong> such as neuropathic abdominal pain, peripheral motor neuropathy, and <strong>psychiatric disturbances</strong>.</li>\n<li>These symptoms are frequently triggered by factors like<strong> fasting</strong>, drugs, or <strong>hormonal changes</strong>. While hepatic porphyrias mostly manifest in adults, rare homozygous variants can cause symptoms before puberty.</li>\n<li>In contrast, erythropoietic porphyrias <strong>present early in life</strong>, often from birth or even prenatally, and cause <strong>severe photosensitivity</strong> due to porphyrin accumulation in skin, leading to cell damage and disfigurement.</li>\n<li>Among hepatic porphyrias, acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), and variegate porphyria (VP) usually present with neurologic crises in adulthood, whereas delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase deficiency porphyria (ADP) appears earlier in life.</li>\n<li>Acute Intermittent Porphyria is an autosomal dominant hepatic porphyria caused by partial deficiency of <strong>HMB-synthase enzyme</strong>. Attacks may be precipitated when heme synthesis is increased. Symptoms are more common in <strong>women</strong> and may be worsened during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle due to progesterone levels.</li>\n<li>Porphyria cutanea tarda, although hepatic, presents with blistering skin lesions. Hereditary coproporphyria and variegate porphyria may also show skin involvement. (Option D ruled out).</li>\n<li>Erythropoietic porphyrias include congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP), erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), and X-linked protoporphyria (XLP). These are marked by excess porphyrins in bone marrow and erythrocytes, leading to photosensitivity.</li>\n<li>CEP causes severe<strong> blistering</strong> lesions; EPP and XLP cause <strong>non-blistering, painful photosensitivity</strong>. EPP may affect liver function in a subset of patients, with a small percentage developing progressive liver disease. XLP closely resembles EPP in presentation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Appendicitis (Option B): </strong>Appendicitis presents with abdominal pain but it does not explain the psychiatric symptoms and absence of findings on abdominal imaging.</p>\n<p><strong>Depression (Option C): </strong>Does not explain the recurrent episodes of abdominal pain and hallucinations. The patient also experiences symptom-free intervals.</p>",
