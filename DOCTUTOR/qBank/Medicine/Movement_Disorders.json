The prominent early confusion and delusions make Lewy body dementia more likely in this case.</p>\n<p><strong>Alzheimer's dementia (Option C):</strong> Alzheimer's dementia typically presents with <strong>memory impairment as the prominent initial symptom</strong>, followed by other cognitive deficits. It does not typically present with parkinsonian features or prominent delusions/hallucinations early in the disease course.</p>\n<p><strong>Huntington's chorea (Option D):</strong> Huntington's chorea is characterized by <strong>involuntary choreiform movements</strong>, cognitive decline (often with executive dysfunction), and psychiatric symptoms. The patient's presentation of rigidity and bradykinesia (increased tone, expressionless face, monotonous speech) is inconsistent with the typical hyperkinetic movements of Huntington's chorea.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>The co-occurrence of <strong>parkinsonism, progressive cognitive decline, and psychiatric symptoms like delusions, especially with an early onset of cognitive issues relative to motor symptoms</strong>, is highly suggestive of <strong>Lewy body dementia</strong>.</p>",

SCA7 is associated with blue-yellow color blindness, but the overall clinical picture here is more consistent with Friedreich's.</p>\n<p><strong>Alcoholic cerebellar degeneration (Option C):</strong> Alcoholic cerebellar degeneration primarily affects the cerebellum, causing ataxia, dysarthria, and nystagmus. However, it typically <strong>does not cause absent reflexes (neuropathy) or pes cavus</strong>, and it would generally be seen in the context of chronic heavy alcohol abuse.</p>\n<p><strong>Wilson's disease (Option D):</strong> Wilson's disease presents differently, typically with <strong>parkinsonian features</strong>, dystonia, and characteristic <strong>Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings</strong> in the cornea (not the lens).

The normal neurological examination, apart from the muscle contractions, supports a primary movement disorder.</li>\n<li><strong>Levodopa </strong>is a medication that may help with dystonia.
