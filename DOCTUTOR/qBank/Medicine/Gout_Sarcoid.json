Allopurinol does not increase the metabolism or excretion of uric acid. Instead, it reduces the formation of uric acid by inhibiting xanthine oxidase.</p>\n<p><strong>By inhibiting purine synthesis (Option B): </strong>Incorrect. Allopurinol does not directly inhibit purine synthesis. However, when xanthine and hypoxanthine accumulate, they are recycled via HGPRT in the purine salvage pathway, which provides negative feedback on de novo purine synthesis. This effect is secondary, not the primary mechanism.</p>\n<p><strong>By inhibiting pyrimidine synthesis (Option C): </strong>Incorrect. Allopurinol has no role in pyrimidine metabolism. Pyrimidine synthesis (UMP, CTP, TTP) is an entirely different pathway and is unaffected by xanthine oxidase inhibition.</p>",
