Type A is more common than Type B, and the dissection often extends through the entire length of the aorta.</li>\n<li><strong>Stanford Type B Aortic Dissection:</strong> This tear begins farther down the aorta, in the descending aorta beyond the arch. It usually extends into the abdominal segment but does not involve the first part of the aorta. Surgery may or may not be needed immediately, depending on the dissection's location and if it affects blood flow to organs, often performed with a stent-graft device.</li>\n<li><strong>DeBakey Classification</strong> also defines types: Type 1 originates in the ascending aorta and extends downstream; Type 2 is limited to the ascending aorta (both similar to Stanford Type A); and Type 3 originates in the descending aorta and extends downward (similar to Stanford Type B).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ramipril (Option B):</strong> Ramipril is an oral ACE inhibitor used for long-term blood pressure control, with an onset of action too slow for acute management.</p>\n<p><strong>Refer for urgent cardiothoracic surgery (Option C):</strong> Urgent cardiothoracic surgery is crucial for Type A dissection, but initial blood pressure control is paramount before or concurrently with surgical preparation.</p>\n<p><strong>Echocardiography (Option D):</strong> Echocardiography is an important diagnostic tool, but a CT scan has already confirmed the diagnosis, making immediate blood pressure control the priority.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>In acute aortic dissection, <strong>aggressive control of blood pressure and heart rate</strong> using intravenous agents like labetalol is the most critical immediate management to reduce aortic shear stress and prevent further progression.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The patient presents with severe hypertension and ventricular tachycardia due to a confirmed <strong>phaeochromocytoma</strong>, which involves excessive catecholamine release.</li>\n<li>The most appropriate initial therapy is to <strong>block the alpha-adrenergic effects of the catecholamines</strong> to control the severe hypertension and prevent a hypertensive crisis.</li>\n<li><strong>Phenoxybenzamine</strong> is an alpha-blocker, and the patient should initially be started on alpha-blockers before beta-blockers are introduced. This initial alpha-blockade is crucial to prevent unopposed alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction if beta-blockers are given first.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Amlodipine (Option A):</strong> Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker that is effective for hypertension, but <strong>alpha-blockade is the initial priority in phaeochromocytoma</strong> to prevent unopposed alpha-adrenergic effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Atenolol (Option B):</strong> Atenolol is a beta-blocker. Beta-blockers should <strong>only be introduced after adequate alpha-blockade</strong> in phaeochromocytoma to avoid precipitating a hypertensive crisis from unopposed alpha-receptor stimulation.</p>\n<p><strong>Lidocaine (Option C):</strong> Lidocaine can be <strong>acutely used for sustained ventricular tachycardia</strong>, but the most appropriate <em>initial therapy</em> for the underlying phaeochromocytoma's effects (hypertension and arrhythmias) is alpha-blockade.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> In a patient with phaeochromocytoma presenting with severe hypertension and ventricular tachycardia, <strong>initial management with an alpha-blocker like phenoxybenzamine is paramount</strong> to control blood pressure and prevent unopposed alpha-adrenergic effects before introducing beta-blockers.</p>",
