      "solution": "<p>It is cause by Adenovirus 3,4,7</p><p>The spectrum of viral conjunctivitis varies from mild subclinical disease to severe inflammation with significant morbidity. There will often be a history of a close contact with acute conjunctivitis.</p><ul><li>Non-specific acute follicular conjunctivitis is the most common clinical form of viral conjunctivitis, and is typically due to adenoviral infection by a range of serological variants. Unilateral watering, redness, irritation and/or itching, and mild photophobia occur, the contralateral eye generally being affected 1&ndash;2 days later, often less severely. The condition is usually milder than the other clinical forms of adenoviral conjunctivitis; patients may have accompanying (usually mild) systemic symptoms, such as a sore throat<br> or common cold. </li><li>Pharyngoconjunctival fever (PCF) is caused mainly by adenovirus serovars 3, 4 and 7. It is spread by droplets within families with upper respiratory tract infection. Keratitis develops in about 30% of cases but is seldom severe. Symptoms are essentially as above, though sore throat is typically prominent. </li><li>Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) is caused mainly by adenovirus serovars 8, 19 and 37, and is the most severe ocular adenoviral infection. Keratitis, which may be marked, develops in about 80%; photophobia may be correspondingly prominent. </li><li>Acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis usually occurs in tropical areas. It is typically caused by enterovirus and coxsackievirus, though other microorganisms may present similarly. It has a rapid onset, and resolves within 1&ndash;2 weeks. Conjunctival haemorrhage is generally marked. </li><li>Chronic/relapsing adenoviral conjunctivitis giving a chronic non-specific follicular/papillary clinical picture can persist over years, but is rare and eventually self-limiting. </li><li>Herpes simplex virus (HSV) can cause a follicular conjunctivitis, particularly in primary infection; this is usually unilateral and there are often associated skin vesicles. </li><li>Systemic viral infections such as those common in childhood, e.g. varicella, measles and mumps, can feature an associated follicular conjunctivitis; varicella-zoster virus secondary infection commonly causes a conjunctivitis as part of ophthalmic shingles. An HIV conjunctivitis is recognized. </li><li>Molluscum contagiosum is a skin infection caused by a human specific double-stranded DNA poxvirus that typically affects otherwise healthy children, with a peak incidence between the ages of 2 and 4 years. Transmission is by contact, with subsequent autoinoculation. A chronic follicular conjunctivitis can be associated, and is due to skin lesion shedding of viral particles. Chronic unilateral ocular irritation and mild discharge is typical. The eyelash line should be examined carefully in patients with chronic conjunctivitis so as not to overlook a molluscum lesion.</li></ul><p>Ref: Parson&rsquo;s diseases of eye 23rd edition pg 148</p>",

      "solution": "<p>The lens is a biconvex mass of peculiarly differentiated epithelium. It has three main parts: the lens capsule, the lens epithelium and the lens fibres. The outer capsule lined by the epithelium and the lens fibres and is developed from an invagination of the surface ectoderm of the fetus, so that what was originally the surface of the epithelium comes to lie in the centre of the lens, the peripheral cells corresponding to the basal cells of the epidermis. Just as the epidermis grows by the proliferation of the basal cells, the old superficial cells being cast off, so the lens grows by the proliferation of the peripheral cells. The old cells, however, cannot be cast off, but undergo changes (sclerosis) analogous to that of the stratum granulosum of the epidermis, and become massed together in the centre or nucleus; moreover, the newly formed cells elongate into fibres. The lens fibres have a complicated architectural form, being arranged in zones in which the fibres growing from opposite directions meet in sutures. Without going into details, it is important to bear in mind that the central nucleus of the lens consists of the oldest cells and the periphery or cortex the youngest (Fig. 1.7).</p><p>The fibres of the lens are split into regions depending on the age of origin. The central denser zone is the nucleus surrounded by the cortex. The oldest and innermost is the central embryonic nucleus (formed during 6&ndash;12 weeks of embryonic life), in which the lens fibres meet around Y-shaped sutures. Outside this embryonic nucleus, successive nuclear zones are laid down as development proceeds, called, depending on the period of formation, the fetal nucleus (3&ndash;8 months of fetal life), the infantile nucleus (last month of intrauterine life till puberty), the adult nucleus (corresponding to the lens in early adult life) and finally and most peripherally, the cortex consisting of the youngest fibres. In this part of the lens, also the fibres meet along the sutures with a general stellate arrangement. The mass of epithelium which constitutes the lens is surrounded by a hyaline membrane, the lens capsule, which is thicker over the anterior than over the posterior surface and is thinnest at the posterior pole; the thickest basement membrane in the body, the lens capsule, is a cuticular deposit secreted by the epithelial cells, having on the outside a thin membrane, the zonular lamella.</p><p>The lens in fetal life is almost spherical; it gradually becomes flattened so as to assume a biconvex shape. It is held in place by the suspensory ligament or zonule of Zinn. This is not a complete membrane, but consists of bundles of strands which pass from the surface of the ciliary body to the capsule where they join with the zonular lamella. The strands pass in various directions so that the bundles often cross one another. Thus, the most posterior arise from the pars plana of the ciliary body almost as far back as the ora serrata; these lie in contact with the ciliary body for a considerable distance and then curve towards the equator of the lens to be inserted into the capsule slightly anterior to the equator. A second group of bundles springs from the summits and sides of the ciliary processes, i.e. far forwards, and passes backwards to be inserted into the lens capsule slightly posterior to the equator. A third group passes from the summits of the processes almost directly inwards to be inserted at the equator.</p><p>Ref: Parson&rsquo;s diseases of eye 23rd edition pg 233</p>",

A larger capsulotomy may be necessary if glare persists, or for retinal examination or treatment, but the capsulotomy should not extend beyond the edge of the optic in case vitreous prolapses around its edge. It may be prudent to adopt a higher threshold for treatment, and minimizing its extent, in eyes at risk of retinal detachment (e.g. high myopia), CMO (e.g. history of uveitis) or lens displacement (e.g. pseudoexfoliation).

It is related to poverty, overcrowding and poor hygiene, the morbidity being a consequence of the establishment of re-infection cycles within communities. Whereas an isolated episode of trachomatous conjunctivitis may be relatively innocu- ous, recurrent infection elicits a chronic immune response con- sisting of a cell-mediated delayed hypersensitivity (Type IV) reaction to the intermittent presence of chlamydial antigen and can lead to loss of sight. Prior contact with the organism confers short-term partial immunity but also leads to a heightened inflam- matory reaction upon reinfection. Vaccination has an effect similar to primary infection in sensitizing the individual, and so is not helpful. The family childcare group is the most important re-infection reservoir, and consequently young children are par- ticularly vulnerable. The fly is an important vector, but there may be direct transmission from eye or nasal discharge. Trachoma is associated principally with infection by serovars A, B, Ba and C of Chlamydia trachomatis, but the serovars D&ndash;K conventionally asso- ciated with adult inclusion conjunctivitis, and other species of the Chlamydiaceae family such as Chlamydophila psittaci and Chlamy- dophila pneumoniae have also been implicated.</p><p>Ref:Kanski&rsquo;s Clinical Ophthalmology: A systemic Approach, 8th edition pg 871</p>",

Probing can be repeated if a first procedure is unsuccessful. Nasal endoscopic guidance may enhance success, and should be considered at least for repeat procedures. If symptoms are mild&ndash;moderate, probing may be delayed until the age of 12&ndash;18, or even 24, months and is carried out under general anaesthesia. For more marked symptoms, early probing may be appropriate and in young children is sometimes performed under topical anaesthesia in an outpatient setting.

Thus, histologically the central retinal vessel remains artery and vein only for a short distance found the optic disc, and turns into arterioles and venules.

VKH predominantly affects Hispanic, Japanese and pigmented individuals; it is associated with HLA-DR1 and HLA-DR4 across different racial groups. VKH is sometimes sub- divided into Vogt&ndash;Koyanagi disease, characterized mainly by skin changes and anterior uveitis, and Harada disease, in which neuro- logical features and exudative retinal detachments predominate.</p><p>Clinical features</p><ul><li>Prodromal phase lasting a few days: neurological (meningitis and rarely encephalopathy with cranial nerve paresis and other focal lesions) and auditory manifestations (tinnitus, vertigo and deafness). Cranial nerve palsies and optic neuritis may occur. </li><li>Acute uveitic phase. Bilateral granulomatous anterior and multifocal posterior uveitis with diffuse choroidal infiltration, Dalen&ndash;Fuchs nodules (see also sympathetic ophthalmitis below), vitritis, papillitis and exudative retinal detachments. Ciliary effusion with iris-lens diaphragm rotation can occur. </li><li>Convalescent phase follows several weeks later: localized alopecia, poliosis and vitiligo; depigmented fundus appearance (&lsquo;sunset glow&rsquo; fundus) and depigmented limbal lesions (Sugiura sign) in pigmented, especially Japanese, patients. </li><li>Chronic recurrent phase is characterized by smouldering anterior uveitis with exacerbations. Recurrent posterior uveitis is much less common. </li><li>Diagnostic criteria for VKH are set out in Table, in complete VKH, criteria 1&ndash;5 must be present, in incomplete VKH, criteria 1&ndash;3 and either 4 or 5 must be present, and in probable VKH (isolated ocular disease), criteria 1&ndash;3 must be present. </li><li>Ocular complications include choroidal neovascularization, subretinal fibrosis, preretinal and disc new vessels and vitreous haemorrhage, cataract and glaucoma. </li><li>Prognosis is very variable, and is partly dependent on aggressive control in the early stages. Neurological and auditory manifestations tends to resolve but skin, lash and hair changes usually persist.</li></ul><p>Investigation</p><p>Systemic manifestations should be investigated and managed by an appropriate specialist.</p><ul><li>Lumbar puncture if diagnosis uncertain; CSF shows a <br> transient lymphocytic pleocytosis, and melanin-containing <br> </li><li>FAF demonstrates areas of serous detachment. </li><li>OCT allows quantification of subretinal fluid. </li><li>Ultrasonography shows diffuse choroidal thickening and excludes posterior scleritis; UBM can be used to demonstrate ciliary effusions. </li><li>FA of the acute phase shows multifocal hyperfluorescent dots at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium followed by subretinal pooling. The chronic phase shows RPE window defects.</li></ul><p>ICGA during the acute phase of the disease shows regularly distributed hypofluorescent spots, most of which remain hypofluorescent during the late phase, when diffuse hyperfluorescence over the posterior pole is also shown. ICGA is useful for monitoring. <br> Treatment High dose (1&ndash;2 mg/kg/day) oral prednisolone, tapered over 3&ndash;6 months; this may be preceded by intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy (500&ndash;1000 mg/day). Topical steroids and cyclople- gics are used for anterior uveitis. Steroid-resistant patients may require immunosuppressives; biological blockers such as inflixi- mab show promise.</p><br><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0;\"src=\"https://d1mobye7msb5bl.cloudfront.net/QuizJan2022/05032022OPTHALMOLOGY/32E.png\"><p>Ref : Kanski&rsquo;s Clinical Ophthalmology: A systemic Approach, 8th edition pg 416</p>",

Latent convergent squint (esophoria) is often found in hypermetropes, although other forms of heterophoria may occur. The presence of heterophoria increases the tendency to headache and other symptoms of eye strain.</p><p>In older patients, no symptoms may be present until the power of accommodation has diminished to the extent that the near point is beyond the range of comfortable reading distance and work has to be held further off than usual in order to be seen clearly. The greater the degree of hypermetropia, the sooner will this symptom arise; in other words, apparent presbyopia commences at an earlier age than usual.</p><p>The fundus may appear normal on ophthalmoscopy. A bright reflex, suggesting the appearance of watered silk, is commoner in hypermetropic than in emmetropic or myopic eyes; in some cases due to a small optic nerve head with densely packed nerves, the appearance resembles optic neuritis&mdash;a condition known as pseudopapillitis.</p><p>Anatomically, the smallness of the eye affects the entire eye. The diameter of the cornea is often reduced and regular astigmatism is common. The anterior chamber is shallower than usual, owing partly to the normal size of the lens, a configuration which predisposes to angle-closure glaucoma.</p><p>Newborns are almost invariably hypermetropic (average 2.5 D). In the first decades of life, the incidence of hypermetropia falls rapidly, remaining at about 50% after the 20th year. There is no predilection for either sex. It is interesting that primitive races and the higher mammals, especially the carnivores, are generally hypermetropic.</p><p>Ref:Parson&rsquo;s diseases of eye 23rd edition pg 187-188</p>",

Disc size varies on average between racial groups, and is largest in black individuals.

Severe blunt trauma to the globe results in anteroposterior compression with simultaneous expansion in the equatorial plane associated with a transient but severe increase in IOP. Although the impact is primarily absorbed by the lens&ndash;iris diaphragm and the vitreous base, damage can also occur at a distant site such as the posterior pole. The extent of ocular damage depends on the severity of trauma and tends largely to be concentrated to either the anterior or posterior segment. Apart from obvious ocular damage, blunt trauma commonly results in more obscure long-term effects; the prognosis is therefore necessarily guarded.</p><p>Cornea</p><ul><li>Corneal abrasion involves a breach of the epithelium, and stains well with fluorescein.

The iris may momentarily be compressed against the anterior surface of the lens by severe anteroposterior force, with resultant imprinting of pigment from the pupillary margin. Transient miosis accompanies the compression, evidenced by the pattern of pigment corresponding to the size of the miosed pupil (Vossius ring). Damage to the iris sphincter may result in traumatic mydriasis, which can be temporary or permanent; the pupil reacts sluggishly or not at all to both light and accommodation. Radial tears in the pupillary margin are common.</li></ul><br><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0;\"src=\"https://d1mobye7msb5bl.cloudfront.net/QuizJan2022/05032022OPTHALMOLOGY/48E.png\"><ul><li>Acute corneal oedema may develop following blunt trauma, secondary to focal or diffuse dysfunction of the endothelium and is sometimes seen underlying a large abrasion.

The pupil is typically D-shaped and the dialysis is seen as a dark biconvex area near the limbus. An iridodialysis may be asymptomatic if covered by the upper lid; if exposed in the palpebral aperture, uniocular diplopia and glare sometimes ensue, and may necessitate surgical repair of the dehiscence. Traumatic aniridia (360&deg; iridodialysis) is rare; in a pseudophakic eye, the detached iris may be ejected through the cataract surgical incision. </li><li>Ciliary body (see below). Intraocular pressure <br> It is important for IOP to be monitored carefully, particularly in the early period following trauma. Elevation can occur for a variety of reasons, including hyphaema (above) and inflammation (see Ch. 10). In contrast, the ciliary body may react to severe blunt trauma by temporary cessation of aqueous secretion (&lsquo;ciliary shock&rsquo;) resulting in hypotony; it is important for an occult open injury to be excluded as the cause of the hypotony. Tears extending into the face of the ciliary body (angle recession) are associated with a risk of later glaucoma.</li></ul><p>Lens</p><ul><li>Cataract formation is a common sequel to blunt trauma. Postulated mechanisms include direct damage to the lens fibres themselves, and minute ruptures in the lens capsule with an influx of aqueous humour, hydration of lens fibres and consequent opacification. A ring-shaped anterior subcapsular opacity may underlie a Vossius ring. Commonly opacification occurs in the posterior subcapsular cortex along the posterior sutures, resulting in a flower-shaped (&lsquo;rosette&rsquo;) opacity that may subsequently disappear, remain stationary or progress to maturity. Cataract surgery may be necessary for visually significant opacity.</li><li>Subluxation of the lens may occur, secondary to tearing<br> of the suspensory ligament. A subluxated lens tends to deviate towards the meridian of intact zonule; the anterior chamber may deepen over the area of zonular dehiscence, if the lens rotates posteriorly. The edge of a subluxated lens may be visible under mydriasis and trembling of the iris (iridodonesis) or lens (phakodonesis) may be seen on ocular movement. Subluxation of magnitude sufficient to render the pupil partly aphakic may result in uniocular diplopia; lenticular astigmatism due to tilting may occur.</li><li>Dislocation due to 360&deg; rupture of the zonular fibres is rare and may be into the vitreous, or less commonly, into the anterior chamber; an underlying predisposing condition such as pseudoexfoliation should be suspected.</li></ul><p>Ref: Parson&rsquo;s Diseases of the eye 22<sup>nd</sup> edition, Ch.24.
