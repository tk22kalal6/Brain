However, the hypotensive effect is maintained during long-term therapy due to decreased vascular resistance; cardiac output returns to pretreatment values, and extracellular volume returns to almost normal due to compensatory responses such as activation of the RAS. The explanation for the long-term vasodilation induced by thiazide diuretics is unknown. Hydrochlorothiazide may open Ca2+-activated K+ channels, leading to hyperpolarization of vascular smooth muscle cells, which leads in turn to closing of L-type Ca2+ channels and lower probability of opening, resulting in decreased Ca2+ entry and reduced vasoconstriction. Hydrochlorothiazide also inhibits vascular carbonic anhydrase, which, hypothetically, could alter smooth muscle cell systolic pH and thereby cause opening of Ca2+-activated K+ channels with the consequences noted previously.</p><p>Reference: Essentials of Medical Pharmacology by KD Tripathi, 8<sup>th</sup> edition, page no. 606</p>",
