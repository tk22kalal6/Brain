      "solution": "<p>Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), also called acne inversus, is a chronic inflammatory skin condition with lesions including deep-seated nodules and abscesses, draining tracts, and fibrotic scars. These lesions most commonly occur in intertriginous areas and areas rich in apocrine glands. Among the most common are axillary, groin, perianal, perineal, and inframammary locations.</p><p>Environmental and behavioral factors also contribute. Individuals with HS are more commonly overweight or obese. Obesity leads to greater intertriginous surface area and skin friction, increased sweat production and retention, and hormonal changes leading to relative androgen excess, all of which are associated with HS. Metabolic syndrome is more common in obese individuals and thus is also seen more commonly in HS.</p><p>Smoking is also prevalent among those diagnosed with HS. Causation is unclear; however, nicotine may cause increased follicular plugging. As with obesity; disease progression and severity are worse in those who smoke.</p><p>The influence of hormones can be seen in HS. There is a greater prevalance in females than males, with the age of primary occurance most commonly between puberty and menopause. In addition, there are fluctuations of occurance and severity with menstrual cycles and exogenous hormones.</p>",

Ultimately, the repeated picking results in erosions, ulcerations, and long-term scarring with hyper or hypopigmentation When treating a patient with acne excori&eacute;e, it is important to first identify any underlying psychological disorder that could account for skin picking behavior. Since Obsessive&ndash;Compulsive Disorders are associated with serotonin mediated neural pathways, SSRIs can be helpful Cognitive behavioral therapy, habit reversal therapy, and acceptance enhanced behavior, have also been reported to reduce skin picking</p>",

Moreover, the condition has a predilection for men, occurring 20 times more frequently than in women, and starts after adolescence. The natural course of disease starts with the early formation of inflamed papules with marked erythema. Secondary infection can lead to pustules and abscess formation in some cases. Over time, continued inflammation leads to pronounced fibrosis and keloid formation with coalescence of the papules into large plaques and nodules. Later stages of presentation include chronic scarring and/or scarring alopecia without active inflammation. Histologically, there is inflammation, fibroplasias, and disappearance of sebaceous glands.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Miliaria crystallina appears as 1 to 2 mm superficial vesicles, affecting both adults and neonates usually younger than 2 weeks old. Since the pathophysiology involves the most superficial layer of the epidermis, the stratum corneum, the vesicles have a thin superficial layer. This results in the vesicles resembling water droplets on the skin that easily rupture. he vesicles are superficial; therefore, an inflammatory response is typically absent. The upper trunk, neck, and head are the most commonly affected sites. The rash will usually appear within a few days of exposure to risk factors and will resolve within a day after the superficial layer of skin rubs off.</p>",
