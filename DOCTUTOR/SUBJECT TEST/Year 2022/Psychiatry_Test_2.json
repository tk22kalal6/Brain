      "solution": "<ul><li>The term aversive conditioning refers to situations in which behavior is motivated by the threat of an unpleasant stimulus.</li><li>There are two main categories of behavior under aversive control: avoidance behavior and escape behavior. Escape conditioning occurs when the animal learns to perform an operant to terminate an ongoing, aversive stimulus. It is a 'get me out of here' or 'shut this off' reaction, aimed at escape from pain. The behavior that produces escape is negatively reinforced (reinforced by the elimination of the unpleasant stimulus).</li><li>For example, the jump of a rat from electrified platform onto a bowl of water is an escape behavior. Escape conditioning is converted into avoidance conditioning by giving a signal before the aversive stimulus starts. If the animal receives a cue or signal that an aversive stimulus is coming, then after one or two occurrences of the punishing stimulus the cue will trigger an avoidance behavior. This kind of learning occurs quickly and is very durable. For example, if you sounded a tone before you electrified the platform, after one or two trials the rat would respond to the tone by jumping into the water. It would not wait for the shock.</li><li>Avoidance behaviors are very persistent even when there is no longer anything to avoid. The reason is that as a result of an avoidance reaction, one never experiences the aversive stimulus. But this serves as a negative reinforcement, providing a sense of relief. Because of this, avoidance behavior is self-reinforcing.</li></ul><p>Reference: Morgan and King Introduction to Psychology, 7<sup>th</sup> edition, Chapter 4: Principle of learning.</p>",
