Cochlear aplasia (Michel malformation is complete failure of development of the inner ear, both membranous and bony aplasia) is a severe abnormality and is rare. Incomplete formation of the bony and membranous labyrinth, such that the middle and apical turns of cochlea occupy common bony space, is a Mondini malformation. This malformation can be seen in Pendred's syndrome. This may be asymmetrical and auditory function can vary from normal to profound SNHL. Dysplasia of the membranous labyrinth with a normal bony labyrinth is known as a Bing- Siebenman malformation. Partial aplasia of the cochlear duct is the Alexander malformation. This results in high frequency hearing loss.</p><p>DISEASES OF EAR, NOSE AND THROAT &amp; HEAD AND NECK SURGERY PL Dhingra 6th edition chapter 19</p>",
