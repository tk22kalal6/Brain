The normal prothrombin time is about 12 seconds. In each laboratory, a curve relating prothrombin concentration to prothrombin time, such as that shown in Figure 36-5, is drawn for the method used so that the prothrombin in the blood can be quantified. The results obtained for prothrombin time may vary considerably even in the same individual if there are differences in activity of the tissue factor and the analytical system used to perform the test <strong>(hence statement 5 is incorrect).</strong> Tissue factor is isolated from human tissues, such as placental tissue, and different batches may have different activity. The interntional normalized ratio (INR) was devised as a way to standardize measurements of prothrombin time. For each batch of tissue factor, the manufacturer assigns an international sensitivity index (ISI), which indicates the activity of the tissue factor with a standardized sample.

The term &ldquo;androgen&rdquo; means any steroid hormone that has masculinizing effects, including testosterone; it also includes male sex hormones produced elsewhere in the body besides the testes. For instance, the adrenal glands secrete at least five androgens, although the total masculinizing activity of all these is normally so slight (&lt;5 percent of the total in the adult male) that even in women they do not cause significant masculine characteristics, except for causing growth of pubic and axillary hair. But when an adrenal tumor of the adrenal androgen-producing cells occurs, the quantity of androgenic hormones may then become great enough to cause all the usual male secondary sexual characteristics to occur even in the female. These effects are described in connection with the adrenogenital syndrome in Chapter 77.

      "solution": "<p>One of the most common causes of female sterility is endometriosis, a common condition in which endometrial tissue almost identical to that of the normal uterine endometrium grows and even menstruates in the pelvic cavity surrounding the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. Endometriosis causes fibrosis throughout the pelvis, and this fibrosis sometimes so enshrouds the ovaries that an ovum cannot be released into the abdominal cavity. Often, endometriosis occludes the fallopian tubes, either at the fimbriated ends or elsewhere along their extent. Another common cause of female infertility is salpingitis, that is, inflammation of the fallopian tubes; this causes fibrosis in the tubes, thereby occluding them. In the past, such inflammation occurred mainly as a result of gonococcal infection. But with modern therapy, this is becoming a less prevalent cause of female infertility. Still another cause of infertility is secretion of abnormal mucus by the uterine cervix. Ordinarily, at the time of ovulation, the hormonal environment of estrogen causes the secretion of mucus with special characteristics that allow rapid mobility of sperm into the uterus and actually guide the sperm up along mucous &ldquo;threads.&rdquo; Abnormalities of the cervix itself, such as low-grade infection or inflammation, or abnormal hormonal stimulation of the cervix, can lead to a viscous mucous plug that prevents fertilization.</p><p>Option C is actually one of the treatment modalities used for sterile females with hyposecretion from the pituitary gland.</p><p>(Ref.

There are also two types of muscle spindle intrafusal fibers: (1) nuclear bag muscle fibers (one to three in each spindle), in which several muscle fiber nuclei are congregated in expanded &ldquo;bags&rdquo; in the central portion of the receptor area, as shown by the top fiber in Figure 54-4, and (2) nuclear chain fibers (three to nine), which are about half as large in diameter and half as long as the nuclear bag fibers and have nuclei aligned in a chain throughout the receptor area, as shown by the bottom fiber in the figure. The primary sensory nerve ending (the 17-micrometer sensory fiber) is excited by both the nuclear bag intrafusal fibers and the nuclear chain fibers. Conversely, the secondary ending (the 8-micrometer sensory fiber) is usually excited only by nuclear chain fibers. These relations are shown in Figure 54-4.</p><p>Ref : Guyton and hall textbook of medical physiology 12 th edition PG 657</p>",
