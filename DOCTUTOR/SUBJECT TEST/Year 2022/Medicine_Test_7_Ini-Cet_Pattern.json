Hypertension is the main risk factor for all intracerebral hemorrhages, but it usually affects deep penetrating vessels and causes hemorrhages in the basal ganglia, thalamus, brainstem, or cerebellum. Anticoagulant medications, such as warfarin, increase the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage for patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy but are not the primary cause. An arteriovenous malformation would be unlikely given the normal findings with CT angiography of the brain.</p>",

Much of the recent reduction in mortality related to variceal bleed- ing is probably due to the increasing use of prophylactic antibiotics in patients with cirrhosis and gastrointestinal tract bleeding. Transjugular intrahepatic portal systemic shunt is not necessary unless bleeding cannot be controlled with endoscopy or medical therapy. Although the hemo- globin level should be carefully monitored, the patient is hemodynamically stable and does not need transfusion now. Overtransfusion, when hemoglobin is greater than 8 to 9 g/dL, can precipitate recurrence of bleeding and fluid overload. Fresh frozen plasma is also not necessary since the INR is relatively normal.

The Valsalva maneuver decreases venous return, which would result in a smaller left ventricle and thus an earlier mitral valve pro- lapse.

Stress testing may have false-positive or false-negative results in patients with dilated cardio- myopathy. Endomyocardial biopsy should not be routinely performed in the evaluation of patients with heart failure. Holter monitoring is useful in detecting the PVC burden over a 24-hour period, and if the PVC burden were especially high, it could be implicated as a rare cause of heart failure. However, Holter minitoring would not be the next step in evaluation and should not be performed without initiating medical therapy because indicated medical treatment (eg, &beta;-blockers) can attenuate PVCs. Sleep apnea could be a frequent accompaniment of decompensated heart failure, but a sleep study should be performed only after patients are optimally treated.</p>",

The conditions that are considered to be contraindications to pregnancy are idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension and Eisenmenger syndrome (congenital heart disease resulting in pulmonary hypertension with right-to-left shunting). In these cases, it is typically recommended to terminate the pregnancy because there is a high risk of maternal and fetal death. Peripartum cardiomyopathy can recur in subsequent pregnancies, and it is recommended that individuals with an abnormal ejection fraction avoid further pregnancies. Approximately 15% of individuals with Marfan syndrome will have a major cardiovascular complication in pregnancy, although the condition is not considered a contraindication to pregnancy. An aortic root diameter of less than 40 mm is generally associated with the best outcomes in pregnancy. The valvular heart disease with the greatest risk in pregnancy is mitral stenosis. There is an increased risk of pulmonary edema, and pulmonary hypertension is a common long-term consequence of mitral stenosis. However, aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, and mitral regurgitation are typically well tolerated. Congenital heart disease in the mother is associated with an increased risk of congenital heart disease in the offspring, but atrial and ventricular septal defects are usually well tolerated in pregnancy as long as there is no evidence of Eisenmenger syndrome.</p>",

It can be segregated into Type 1, caused by splanchnic vasodilatation and a reduction in cardiac output leading to profound renal vasoconstriction, or Type 2, where slow incipient renal failure leads to progressive accumulation of refractory ascites. It is essentially a diagnosis of exclusion following assessment for the multiple other causes of renal failure in the critically ill patient with cirrhosis. I Treatment is focused on improving renal blood flow via intravascular volume repletion and vasoconstriction. Albumin is the preferred choice for volume repletion in these patients, but usually commenced at a higher loading dose of 1g/kg up to 100g/day. Terlipressin is likely to be the most efficacious agent, due to splanchnic vasoconstriction and redirection of central blood flow to vital organs.. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) has a role but is a therapy with limited supporting evidence. Furosemide infusion is likely to exacerbate the situation.</p>",
