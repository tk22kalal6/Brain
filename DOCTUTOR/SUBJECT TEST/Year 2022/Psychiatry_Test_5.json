Tremulousness (commonly called the 'shakes' or the 'jitters') develops 6 to 8 hours after the cessation of drinking, the psychotic and perceptual symptoms begin in 8 to 12 hours, seizures in 12 to 24 hours, and DTs anytime during the first 72 hours, although physicians should watch for the development of DTs for the first week of withdrawal. The syndrome of withdrawal sometimes skips the usual progression and, for example, goes directly to DTs.</p><p>Reference: Kaplan &amp; Sadock's Synopsis of Psychiatry, 11<sup>th</sup> edition, chapter 20, substance use and addictive disorders, page 630</p>",

Teens need to develop a sense of self and personal identity. During adolescence, children are exploring their independence and developing a sense of self. As they make the transition from childhood to adulthood, teens may begin to feel confused or insecure about themselves and how they fit into society. As they seek to establish a sense of self, teens may experiment with different roles, activities and behaviours.
