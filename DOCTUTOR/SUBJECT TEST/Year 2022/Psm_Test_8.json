Ex: Many countries in South Asia, and Africa are in this phase.</li><li>Stage 3: Late expanding population - There is a further fall in the death rate, with the birth rate beginning to fall. The population is still increasing due to a net increase in births. India has entered this phase.</li><li>Stage 4: Low stationary population - There is a low birth and low death rate, and this can result in a stationary population. It can also result in zero population growth like in Austria (1980-85). Other examples: the UK, Denmark, Sweden, Belgium recorded a growth rate of 0.1 in 1980-85. It has occurred in most industrialised countries as a demographic transition shifting from high birth and high death rates to low birth and low death rates.</li><li>Stage 5: Contracting population - The birth rate is lower than the death rate, causing population decline. Ex: East European countries like Germany, Hungary</li></ul></li><li>Another important concept of the demographic cycle is the demographic gap which is the difference between birth rate and death rate. The demographic gap is maximum in the early-expanding phase, characterised by a high birth rate and low death rate. As the demography of the country transitions to the late-expanding phase, both birth rate and death rate falls causing a decreasing demographic gap. Although the birth rate is falling in the late-expanding phase, it is still higher than the death rate, which causes the population to increase.</li></ul><p>Reference: Park's Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine 25th edition Page no 530</p>",
