      "solution": "<ul><li>The transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, or prion diseases, are fatal neurodegenerative diseases characterized by spongiform changes, astrocytic gliomas, and neuronal loss resulting from the deposition of insoluble protein aggregates in neural cells.</li><li>They include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, scrapie in sheep, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease) in cattle. A variant form of Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (vCJD) that afflicts younger patients is associated with early-onset psychiatric and behavioural disorders.</li><li>Prion diseases may manifest themselves as infectious, genetic, or sporadic disorders. Because no viral or bacterial gene encoding the pathologic prion protein could be identified, the source and mechanism of transmission of prion disease long remained elusive. Today it is recognized that prion diseases are protein conformation diseases transmitted by altering the conformation, and hence the physical properties, of proteins endogenous to the host.</li><li>Human prion-related protein (PrP), a glycoprotein encoded on the short arm of chromosome 20, normally is monomeric and rich in &alpha; helix. Pathologic prion proteins serve as the templates for the conformational transformation of normal PrP, known as PrPc, into PrPsc. PrPsc is rich in &beta; sheet with many hydrophobic aminoacyl side chains exposed to solvent.</li><li>As each new PrPsc molecule is formed, it triggers the production of yet more pathologic variants in a conformational chain reaction. Because PrPsc molecules associate strongly with one another through their exposed hydrophobic regions, the accumulating PrPsc units coalesce to form insoluble protease-resistant aggregates. Since one pathologic prion or prion-related protein can serve as template for the conformational transformation of many times its number of PrPc molecules, prion diseases can be transmitted by the protein alone without involvement of DNA or RNA.</li><li>Option B: Refolding or misfolding of another protein endogenous to human brain tissue, &beta;-amyloid, is a prominent feature of the Alzheimer disease. While the main cause of the Alzheimer disease remains elusive, the characteristic senile plaques and neurofibrillary bundles contain aggregates of the protein &beta;-amyloid, a 4.3-kDa polypeptide produced by proteolytic cleavage of a larger protein known as amyloid precursor protein.</li><li>In Alzheimer disease patients, levels of &beta;-amyloid become elevated, and this protein undergoes a conformational transformation from a soluble &alpha; helix-rich state to a state rich in &beta; sheet and prone to self aggregation. Apolipoprotein E has been implicated as a potential mediator of this conformational transformation.</li><li>Option C: Thalassemias are caused by genetic defects that impair the synthesis of one of the polypeptide subunits of hemoglobin. During the burst of hemoglobin synthesis that occurs during erythrocyte development, a specific chaperone called &alpha;-hemoglobin-stabilizing protein (AHSP) binds to free hemoglobin &alpha;-subunits awaiting incorporation into the hemoglobin multimer.</li><li>In the absence of this chaperone, free &alpha;-hemoglobin subunits aggregate, and the resulting precipitate has cytotoxic effects on the developing erythrocyte. Investigations using genetically modified mice suggest a role for AHSP in modulating the severity of &beta;-thalassemia in human subjects.</li><li>Option D: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a group of connective tissue disorders that involve impaired integrity of supporting structures. It is genetic disease occurs due to altered codon (mutation).</li></ul><p>Reference: Harper's illustrated biochemistry 31<sup>st</sup> edition CH 5 PN 42</p>",

Some well-known examples include arsenic, antimony, lead, mercury, and cadmium, whose toxicity can arise via a number of mechanisms like Displacement of an Essential Cation, Enzyme Inactivation and Formation of Reactive Oxygen Species.</li><li>Option A: Displacement of an Essential Cation:</li></ul><p>The ability of a heavy metal to displace a functionally essential metal can readily lead to loss or impairment of function. Classic examples include the displacement of iron by gallium in the enzymes ribonucleotide reductase and Fe, Cu superoxide dismutase. Ga3+, while of similar size and identical charge to Fe3+, lacks the multivalence capability of iron. Replacement of Fe3+ by Ga3+ therefore renders affected enzymes catalytically inert.</p><ul><li>Option B: Heavy metals are not displacing anions.</li><li>Option C: Enzyme Inactivation: Heavy metals readily form adducts with free sulfhydryl groups. If present in proteins, formation of these adducts undermines a protein's structural integrity, with concomitant impairment of function. Examples include the inhibition of &delta;-aminolevulinate synthase by Pb and the inactivation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex by arsenic or mercury. In pyruvate dehydrogenase, the heavy metals react with the sulfhydryl on the essential prosthetic group, lipoic acid, rather than with a peptidyl cysteine.</li><li>Option D: Formation of Reactive Oxygen Species: Heavy metals can induce the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can then damage DNA, membrane lipids, and other biomolecules. Oxidative damage to DNA can cause genetic mutations that may lead to cancer or other pathophysiologic conditions. ROS-mediated peroxidation of lipid molecules can lead to the loss of membrane integrity.</li><li>The resulting dissipation of action potentials and disruption of various cross-membrane transport processes can be particularly deleterious to neurologic and neuromuscular functions. It has also been reported that rats fed with excessive levels of heavy metals are prone to develop cancerous tumors.</li></ul><p>Reference: Harper's illustrated biochemistry 31<sup>st</sup> edition CH 10 PN 94</p>",

Some well-known examples include arsenic, antimony, lead, mercury, and cadmium, whose toxicity can arise via a number of mechanisms like Displacement of an Essential Cation, Enzyme Inactivation and Formation of Reactive Oxygen Species.</li><li>Option A: Displacement of an Essential Cation:</li></ul><p>The ability of a heavy metal to displace a functionally essential metal can readily lead to loss or impairment of function. Classic examples include the displacement of iron by gallium in the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase and Fe, Cu superoxide dismutase. Ga3+, while of similar size and identical charge to Fe3+, lacks the multivalence capability of iron. Replacement of Fe3+ by Ga3+ therefore renders affected enzymes catalytically inert.</p><ul><li>Option B: Heavy metals are not displacing anions.</li><li>Option C: Enzyme Inactivation: Heavy metals readily form adducts with free sulfhydryl groups. If present in proteins, formation of these adducts undermines a protein's structural integrity, with concomitant impairment of function. Examples include the inhibition of &delta;-aminolevulinate synthase by Pb and the inactivation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex by arsenic or mercury. In pyruvate dehydrogenase, the heavy metals react with the sulfhydryl on the essential prosthetic group, lipoic acid, rather than with a peptidyl cysteine.</li><li>Option D: Formation of Reactive Oxygen Species: Heavy metals can induce the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can then damage DNA, membrane lipids, and other biomolecules. Oxidative damage to DNA can cause genetic mutations that may lead to cancer or other pathophysiologic conditions. ROS-mediated peroxidation of lipid molecules can lead to the loss of membrane integrity. The resulting dissipation of action potentials and disruption of various cross-membrane transport processes can be particularly deleterious to neurologic and neuromuscular functions. It has also been reported that rats fed with excessive levels of heavy metals are prone to develop cancerous tumors.</li></ul><p>Reference: Harper's illustrated biochemistry 31<sup>st</sup> edition CH 10 PN 93</p>",

Codons are presented in mRNA language of four nucleotides (adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C) and uracil (U)). The four nucleotide bases are used to produce the three-base codons.
