Diabetes insipidus is a relatively rare disease characterized by the excretion of large volumes of dilute urine as a result of either a deficiency of or a resistance to the actions of the posterior pituitary hormone antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as arginine vasopressin (AVP).</li><li>ADH is released into the circulation from the posterior pituitary gland in response to an increase in serum osmolality, and acts to increase reabsorption of water by causing the insertion of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) channels into the apical membrane of the distal parts of the nephron. Deficiency of ADH leads to central diabetes insipidus (CDI), while failure of the kidney to respond to its actions causes nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI).</li><li>Diagnosis of diabetes insipidus includes basic laboratory investigations and a fluid deprivation test.</li><li>Hypernatremia may be found secondary to dehydration, while urinalysis may show a low specific gravity. Serum osmolality is increased due to excess free water loss. It may be formally measured, or estimated using the formula: 2 &times; [Na+] + [urea] + [glucose], as these are the main solutes in plasma. (For this patient, estimated serum osmolality would be around 300 mOsm/kg.) Similarly, urine osmolality will be low, generally less than 200mOsm/kg, due to inadequate reabsorption of water from the distal parts of the nephron.</li></ul><p><strong>Reference:</strong> (Robbins 10<sup>th</sup> ed, Pg- 755; Harshmohan, 7<sup>th</sup> ed, Pg- 640)</p>",

      "solution": "<ul><li>The most likely cause of death is respiratory failure resulting from chronic obstructive pulmonary (or airway) disease (COPD). COPD refers to two separate disorders, chronic bronchitis and emphysema, which commonly co-exist and are characterized by progressive and irreversible damage to the lungs and airways that limits airflow to and from the lungs. Cigarette smoking is, by far, the most common causative factor of COPD. COPD is a major cause of morbidity and ranks in the ten most common causes of death worldwide. Although there are typical clinical and radiological features of COPD, this diagnosis, in life, is made on the basis of lung function tests (spirometry).</li><li>Emphysema is the result of chronic inflammation of the airways and lungs, with release of inflammatory mediators resulting in destruction of alveolar walls. As a result of this the alveolar surface area needed for gas exchange is reduced and there is loss of structural support for intrapulmonary airways which are then more likely to collapse and trap air within the lungs. This chronic over-inflation of the lungs leads to the classic barrel-shaped enlargement of the chest (increased anteroposterior diameter). Typical clinical features of emphysema include progressive dyspnoea (usually a relatively late sign), coughing, wheezing and weight loss. Patients typically show prolonged expiration due to entrapment of air, tend to sit hunched forwards and breathe through pursed lips.</li><li>Emphysema and long-standing severe chronic bronchitis may lead to respiratory failure or cause pulmonary hypertension with the latter leading to increased strain on the right ventricle. This culminates in cor pulmonale (pure right-sided heart failure). Both conditions can result in sudden death. Rupture of a bulla can result in pneumothorax, which may also result in sudden death, especially in a patient with already compromised respiratory function.</li></ul><p><strong>Reference:</strong> (Robbins 10<sup>th</sup> ed, Pg- 498; Harshmohan, 7<sup>th</sup> ed, Pg- 458)</p>",

Pathologically, typical caseating tubercles with discharging sinuses through the surface of the breast are found. ZN staining may demonstrate acid-fast bacilli. Fungal infection of the breast may occur in immunocompromised patients.</li><li>Ziehl-Nielsen staining is a bacteriological stain used to identify acid-fastorganisms, mainly Mycobacteria.

Some mycobacteria are free-living saprophytes, but many are pathogens that cause disease in animals and humans.Mycobacterium bovis causes tuberculosis in cattle. Since tuberculosis can be spread to humans, milk is pasteurized to kill any of the bacteria.The Mycobacteria species that causes tuberculosis(TB) in humans is Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is an airborne bacterium that typically infects the human lungs. Testing for TB includes blood testing, skin tests, and chest X-rays.When looking at the smears for TB, it is stained using an acid-fast stain. These acid-fast organisms like Mycobacterium contain large amounts of lipid substances within their cell walls called mycolic acids. These acids resist staining by ordinary methods such as a Gram stain.It can also be used to stain a few other bacteria, such as Nocardia. The reagents used for Ziehl-Nielsen staining are carbol fuchsin, acid alcohol, and methylene blue. Acid-fast bacilli are bright red after staining.<strong></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Reference:</strong> (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ziehl%E2%80%93Neelsen_stain&amp;oldid=1096977948)</p>",

The net effect is to cause the accumulation of intracellular lipids.</li><li>The cause of alcoholic hepatitis is uncertain, but it may stem from one or more of the following toxic by products of ethanol and its metabolites:</li><li>Acetaldehyde (a major metabolite of ethanol) induces lipid peroxidation and acetaldehyde-protein adduct formation, which may disrupt cytoskeleton and membrane function.</li><li>Alcohol directly affects mitochondrial function and membrane fluidity.<ul><li>Reactive oxygen species generated during oxidation of ethanol by the microsomal ethanol oxidizing system react with and damage membranes and proteins.

They represent aggregates of cyto-skeletal intermediate fi laments (pre-keratin). They can be best visualised with connective tissue stains like Masson's trichrome and chromophobe aniline blue, or by the use of immune-peroxidase methods. Mallory bodies are highly suggestive of, but not specific for, alcoholic hepatitis since Mallory bodies are also found in certain other conditions such as: primary biliary cirrhosis, Indian childhood cirrhosis, cholestatic syndromes, Wilson's disease, intestinal bypass surgery, focal nodular hyperplasia and hepatocellular carcinoma.</li><li><strong>Inflammatory response:</strong> Th e areas of hepatocellular necrosis and regions of Mallory bodies are associated with an inflammatory infiltrate, chiefly consisting of polymorphs and some scattered mononuclear cells. In more extensive necrosis, the inflammatory infiltrate is more widespread and may involve the entire lobule.</li><li><strong>Fibrosis:</strong> Most cases of alcoholic hepatitis are accompanied by pericellular and perivenular fibrosis, producing a web-like or chicken wire-like appearance.

      "solution": "<ul><li>The pathogenesis of the long-term complications of diabetes is multifactorial, although persistent hyperglycaemia (glucotoxicity) seems to be a key mediator. At least three distinct metabolic pathways seem to be involved in the pathogenesis of long-term complications; it is likely that all of them play a role in a tissue-specific manner.</li></ul><ol><li>Formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). AGEs are formed as a result of nonenzymatic reactions between intracellular glucose-derived precursors (glyoxal, methylglyoxal, and 3-deoxyglucosone) and the amino groups of proteins. The rate of AGE formation is greatly accelerated by hyperglycaemia. AGEs bind to a specific receptor (RAGE), which is expressed on inflammatory cells (macrophages and T cells), endothelium and vascular smooth muscle. The detrimental effects of AGE-RAGE signalling within the vascular compartment include the following:</li></ol><ul><li>Release of cytokines and growth factors, including transforming growth factor &beta; (TGF&beta;), which leads to deposition of excess basement membrane material, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), implicated in diabetic retinopathy</li><li>Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in endothelial cells</li><li>Increased procoagulant activity on endothelial cells and macrophages</li><li>Enhanced proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and synthesis of extracellular matrix In addition to receptor-mediated effects, AGEs can directly cross-link extracellular matrix proteins.</li></ul><p>These crosslinked proteins can trap other plasma or interstitial proteins; for example, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) gets trapped within AGE-modified large-vessel walls, accelerating atherosclerosis, while albumin can be trapped within capillary walls, accounting in part for the basement membrane thickening that is characteristic of diabetic microangiopathy.</p><li>Activation of protein kinase C. Activation of intracellular protein kinase C (PKC) by calcium ions and the second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG) is an important signal transduction pathway in many cellular systems. Intracellular hyperglycaemia can stimulate the de novo synthesis of DAG from glycolytic intermediates and hence cause activation of PKC. The downstream effects of PKC activation are numerous and include production of proangiogenic molecules such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), implicated in the neovascularization seen in diabetic retinopathy, and profibrogenic molecules such as transforming growth factor &beta;, leading to increased deposition of extracellular matrix and basement membrane material.</li><li>Disturbances in polyol pathways. In some tissues that do not require insulin for glucose transport (e.g., nerves, lens, kidneys, blood vessels), hyperglycaemia leads to an increase in intracellular glucose that is then metabolized by the enzyme aldose reductase to sorbitol, a polyol, and eventually to fructose, in a reaction that uses NADPH (the reduced form of nicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate) as a cofactor. NADPH also is required by the enzyme glutathione reductase in a reaction that regenerates reduced glutathione (GSH). GSH is one of the important anti-oxidant mechanisms in the cell, and reductions in GSH increase cellular susceptibility to oxidative stress. In neurons, persistent hyperglycaemia appears to be the major underlying cause of diabetic neuropathy (glucose neurotoxicity).</li><p><strong>Reference:</strong> (Robbins, 10<sup>th</sup> ed, Pg- 778)</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Pyogenic osteomyelitis is almost always caused by bacteria and rarely by fungi. Organisms may reach the bone by</p><p>(1) hematogenous spread,</p><p>(2) extension from a contiguous site, and</p><p>(3) direct implantation after compound fractures or orthopaedic procedures. In otherwise healthy children, most osteomyelitis is hematogenous in origin and develops in the long bones.</p><ul><li>In adults, however, osteomyelitis more often occurs as a complication of open fractures, surgical procedures, and infections of the feet in diabetics.</li><li>Staphylococcus aureus is responsible for 80% to 90% of the cases of culture-positive pyogenic osteomyelitis.</li><li>These organisms express cell wall proteins that bind to bone matrix components such as collagen and facilitate adherence to bone.</li><li>Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas, and Klebsiella are more frequently isolated from individuals with genitourinary tract infections or who are intravenous drug abusers. Mixed bacterial infections are seen in the setting of direct spread, inoculation of organisms during surgery, or into open fractures.</li><li>In the neonatal period, Haemophilus influenzae and group B streptococci are frequent pathogens, and individuals with sickle cell disease are predisposed to Salmonella infection.</li><li>In almost 50% of suspected cases, no organisms can be isolated. The osseous vascular circulation, which varies with age, determines the location of infection in most long bones.</li><li>In infants and adults, vascular communication allows the spread of infection between the metaphysis and the epiphysis.</li><li>By contrast, the avascular growth plate in the child interrupts infection spread between the metaphysis and epiphysis.</li><li><strong>Morphology:</strong> Changes associated with osteomyelitis depend on the stage (acute, subacute, or chronic) and location of the infection. In the acute phase, bacteria proliferate and induce a neutrophilic inflammatory reaction. Necrosis of bone cells and marrow ensues within the first 48 hours.</li><li>The bacteria and inflammation spread longitudinally and radially throughout the Haversian systems to reach the periosteum.</li><li>In children, the periosteum is loosely attached to the cortex.</li><li>Thus, sizable subperiosteal abscess may form that dissect for long distances along the bone surface.</li><li>Lifting of the periosteum further impairs the blood supply to the affected region, contributing to the necrosis.</li><li>The dead bone is known as a sequestrum. Rupture of the periosteum leads to a soft tissue abscess, which can channel to the skin, creating a draining sinus.</li><li>Sometimes the sequestrum crumbles, releasing fragments that pass through the sinus tract.</li><li>In infants (and uncommonly in adults), epiphyseal infection may spread through the articular surface or along capsular and tendoligamentous insertions into a joint, producing septic or suppurative arthritis, which can cause destruction of the articular cartilage and permanent disability.</li><li>After the first week, chronic inflammatory cells release cytokines that stimulate osteoclastic bone resorption, ingrowth of fibrous tissue, and the deposition of reactive bone at the periphery.</li><li>The newly deposited bone can form a shell of living tissue, known as an involucrum, around the segment of devitalized infected bone.</li><li>The histologic findings of chronic osteomyelitis are more protean but typically involve marrow fibrosis, sequestrum, and an inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma cells.</li></ul><p><strong>Reference:</strong> (Robbins, 10<sup>th</sup> ed, Pg- 807)</p>",
