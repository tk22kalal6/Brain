He had an episode of an acute exacerbation of asthma 5 days ago, for which he was given inhaled salbutamol, inhaled prednisolone and levofloxacin to prevent secondary bacterial infection. The patient has been asthmatic since 50 years. His saturation on room air was 80%. Examination revealed bilateral diffuse wheezing and pharyngeal wall erythema. Electrocardiogram was normal and chest X-ray was without any infiltrate. Peak expiratory flow rate was 200 L/min. Diagnostic impression was asthma exacerbation secondary to acute bronchitis. Intravenous methylprednisolone 40 mg every 8 hours, bronchodilators, and levofloxacin were given. Serum mycoplasma antibody, urine legionella antigen, nasal swab for respiratory syncytial virus and influenza antigen, and rapid streptococcal throat tests were negative. On day 5 of admission, a high-resolution contrast tomographic (HRCT) scanning of the chest revealed bilateral multifocal ground glass opacities. Sputum study revealed aspergillus infection.
