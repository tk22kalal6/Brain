These glasses cause the fixation light to appear as an elongated streak perpendicular to the striations. The lenses are usually placed at 135 degrees in front of the one eye and at 45 degrees in front of the other. Each eye receives a similar, fusible image, with the exception of the line, allowing simultaneous perception to be observed. With both eyes, the patient should see a cross. This test is minimally dissociative for the assessment of retinal correspondence.[citation needed]</li><li>Apart from testing binocular functions, Bagolini striated glasses can measure cyclotropia. The principle of the test is similar to that of double Maddox rod test. The glasses are placed in the trial frames with the striations vertical, giving rise to two horizontal line images when viewing a spotlight. If the patient has a vertical deviation, the lines will be seen one above the other. If there is little or no vertical separation, vertical prism can be used to separate the lines. The patient is asked if one or both lines are tilted. The lines can be straightened subjectively by rotating the glasses in the trial frame and the degree of cyclotropia recorded.</li><li>Indications for use</li><li>video covering the Bagolini Striated Test</li><li>he BSGT is used for patients with strabismus to test for suppression, normal retinal correspondence or abnormal retinal correspondence,[2] particularly in cases of manifest strabismus</li></ul><ul><li>The Bagolini Striated Glasses Test is the test most likely to allow the demonstration of fusion in patients who fuse intermittently. Harmonious anomalous retinal correspondence is found more frequently when using Bagolini Striated Glasses Test than with the Worth 4 dot test or the synoptophore.</li></ul><p>Reference: KANSKI'S Clinical Ophthalmology, A Systematic Approach, Ninth Edition, chapter. 7, page number: 214-221</p>",

In it, upper lid is everted and the upper tarsal border along with its attached Muller's muscle and conjunctiva are resected.</li> <li>in 1961 Fasanella and Servat first introduced an excision of the tarsoconjunctival tissue, M&uuml;ller's muscle, and levator palpebrae superioris to correct small amounts of ptosis in patients with good levator function.Since its inception, more than 30 modifications have been proposed to improve safety and allow ease of use without compromising surgical results. The procedure addresses all types of ptosis, including congenital, myogenic, neurogenic, traumatic, ptosis from Horner's syndrome, and ptosis following enucleation.This procedure is indicated for correction of mild to moderate ptosis, with at least 10 mm of levator function and no more than 3 mm of ptosis, preferably with a negative phenylephrine test.</li> </ul> <p>Surgical Steps</p> <ul> <li>The preoperative assessment includes measurements of the palpebral fissure height, levator function, and margin-to-reflex distance-1 (MRD1). Measurements may also be performed both before and 10 minutes after the installation of 2.5% phenylephrine. Samimi et al., advocated for M&uuml;ller's muscle conjunctival resection (MMCR) in patients with a positive phenylephrine test. MMCR usually offers excellent predictability in these patients.Nonetheless, high functional and cosmetic success can still be achieved in patients with a positive phenylephrine test.</li> <li>The procedure begins with injection of local anesthetic agent infiltrated subconjunctivally above the superior border of the tarsal plate while the eyelid is everted over a Demarres retractor. 4-0 silk traction sutures may be placed at the nasal and temporal ends of the superior border of tarsus.</li> <li>A caliper or ruler is used to mark the amount of superior tarsus and immediately adjacent to Muller's muscle and conjunctiva while the traction sutures are held with moderate tension. The amount of tarsus and M&uuml;ller's muscle-conjunctiva complex to be excised is debatable but no more than 3 mm of the tarsus should be marked.</li> <li>Two curved hemostats are placed just above the marked line to grasp the tarsoconjunctival M&uuml;ller's complex. Skin and oribicularis should not be clamped. The tip of the clamps should meet at the highest point of eyelid arch desired, which is approximately above the pupils. A Putterman clamp may also be used for easy, single hand manipulation.</li> <li>A double armed 6-0 plain gut suture, or a 6-0 prolene suture in some cases, is placed in the medial lid below the hemostat. One arm is then run laterally full thickness through the tissue to be plicated approximately 1.5 mm beneath the hemostat.</li> <li>The hemostats are released after 60 seconds, leaving an ischemic bed. The crushed tissues are excised using a #15 blade or scissors while sparing the sutures.</li> <li>The other arm closes the wound towards the lateral edge where the knot may be buried.</li> <li>An alternative to steps #5-7 is to pass the sutures in a running horizontal mattress fashion across the lid then reversed to complete the closure. A #15 blade may be used to excise the tissues by making metal on metal contact with the curved hemostats or the Putterman clamp.</li> <li>The knot may also be externalized by passing both needles through full thickness of the lid to the skin near the lateral aspect of superior eyelid crease. Traction sutures are removed if used.</li> <li>A bandage contact lens is used when knots are buried inside the eyelid to avoid corneal abrasion.</li> <li>Antibiotic ointment or eye drops are then applied.

      "solution": "<ul> <li>The exact measurement of intraocular pressure is done by an instrument called tonometer. Indentation (Schiotz tonometer) and applanation (e.g., Goldmann's tonometer) tonometers are frequently used.</li> <li>Tonometry is the procedure eye care professionals perform to determine the intraocular pressure (IOP), the fluid pressure inside the eye. It is an important test in the evaluation of patients at risk from glaucoma.[1] Most tonometers are calibrated to measure pressure in millimeters of mercury (mmHg), with the normal eye pressure range between 10 and 21 mmHg (13&ndash;28 hPa).</li> </ul> <p>Methods</p> <ul> <li>The slit lamp of a Goldmann tonometer Semicircles seen during Goldmann tonometry through slit lamp</li> <li>Applanation tonometry</li> </ul> <p>In applanation tonometry the intraocular pressure (IOP) is inferred from the force required to flatten (applanate) a constant area of the cornea, for the Imbert-Fick law.[2] The Maklakoff tonometer was an early example of this method, while the Goldmann tonometer is the most widely used version in current practice.[3] Because the probe makes contact with the cornea, a topical anesthetic, such as proxymetacaine, is introduced on to the surface of the eye in the form of an eye drop.[citation needed]</p> <ul> <li>Goldmann tonometry</li> </ul> <p>Goldmann tonometry is considered to be the gold standard IOP test and is the most widely accepted method.[4][5] A special disinfected prism is mounted on the tonometer head and then placed against the cornea. The examiner then uses a cobalt blue filter to view two green semicircles. The force applied to the tonometer head is then adjusted using a dial connected to a variable tension spring until the inner edges of the green semicircles in the viewfinder meet. When the area of a circle with diameter 3.06 mm (0.120 in) has been flattened, the opposing forces of corneal rigidity and the tear film are roughly approximate and cancel each other out allowing the pressure in the eye to be determined from the force applied. Like all non-invasive methods, it is inherently imprecise and may need to be adjusted.[6][7]</p> <ul> <li>Perkins tonometer</li> </ul> <p>The Perkins tonometer is a type of portable applanation tonometer, which may be useful in children, anesthetised patients who need to lie flat, or patients unable to co-operate with a sitting slit lamp examination, that yields clinical results comparable to the Goldmann.[8]</p> <ul> <li>Dynamic contour tonometry</li> <li>The PASCAL dynamic contour tonometer</li> </ul> <p>Dynamic contour tonometry (DCT) uses the principle of contour matching instead of applanation. The tip contains a hollow the same shape as the cornea with a miniature pressure sensor in its centre. In contrast to applanation tonometry it is designed to avoid deforming the cornea during measurement and is therefore thought to be less influenced by corneal thickness and other biomechanical properties of the cornea than other methods but because the tip shape is designed for the shape of a normal cornea, it is more influenced by corneal curvature.[9]</p> <p>The probe is placed on the pre-corneal tear film on the central cornea (see gallery) and the integrated piezoresistive pressure sensor automatically begins to acquire data, measuring IOP 100 times per second. The tonometer tip rests on the cornea with a constant appositional force of one gram. When the sensor is subjected to a change in pressure, the electrical resistance is altered and the tonometer's computer calculates a change in pressure according to the change in resistance. A complete measurement cycle requires about eight seconds of contact time. The device also measures the variation in pressure that occurs with the cardiac cycle.</p> <ul> <li>Electronic indentation tonometry</li> </ul> <p>Electronic indentation tonometers are modified Mackay-Marg tonometers that use a free floating transducer to detect the transmitted pressure. The transducer is surrounded by an outer ring that flattens the adjacent cornea reducing its influence on measurement. Because the device touches the cornea, topical anesthetic eye drops are used to numb the eye but as with non-contact tonometry, these devices are often used in children and non-cooperative patients because of their portability and ease of use. Portable electronic tonometers also play a major role in veterinary tonometry.</p> <ul> <li>Rebound tonometry</li> </ul> <p>Rebound tonometers determine intraocular pressure by bouncing a small plastic tipped metal probe against the cornea. The device uses an induction coil to magnetise the probe and fire it against the cornea. As the probe bounces against the cornea and back into the device, it creates an induction current from which the intraocular pressure is calculated. The device is simple and easy to use and self-use versions are available. It is portable, does not require the use of eye drops and is particularly suitable for children and non-cooperative patients.[13]</p> <ul> <li>Pneumatonometry</li> </ul> <p>A pneumatonometer utilizes a pneumatic sensor (consisting of a piston floating on an air bearing). Filtered air is pumped into the piston and travels through a small (5 mm (0.20 in) diameter) fenestrated membrane at one end. This membrane is placed against the cornea. The balance between the flow of air from the machine and the resistance to flow from the cornea affect the movement of the piston and this movement is used to calculate the intra-ocular pressure.[citation needed]</p> <ul> <li>Impression tonometry</li> <li>Schi&oslash;tz tonometer</li> </ul> <p>Impression tonometry (also known as indentation tonometry) measures the depth of corneal indentation made by a small plunger carrying a known weight. The higher the intraocular pressure, the harder it is to push against and indent the cornea. For very high levels of IOP, extra weights can be added to make the plunger push harder.[14] The movement of the plunger is measured using a calibrated scale.[14] The Schi&oslash;tz tonometer is the most common device to use this principle.</p> <ul> <li>Non-corneal and transpalpebral tonometry</li> <li>Diaton transpalpebral tonometer</li> </ul> <p>Transpalpebral tonometry refers to methods of measuring intraocular pressure through the eyelid. The Diaton non-corneal tonometer calculates pressure by measuring the response of a free-falling rod, as it rebounds against the tarsal plate of the eyelid through the sclera. The patient is positioned so that the tip of the device and lid are overlying sclera.[15] Non-corneal and transpalpebral tonometry does not involve contact with the cornea and does not require topical anesthetic during routine use. Transpalpebral tonometry may be useful for measuring postsurgery IOP after myopic LASIK ablation because this technique is not influenced by the treatment.[16] The Diaton tonometer still requires further evaluation and is not a substitute or alternative for more established methods.[17] The Diaton tonometer has a large margin of error compared with commonly used tonometers (e.g., GAT) in most patients (including those with ocular hypertension, glaucoma, and glaucoma tube shunts).</p> <ul> <li>Non-contact tonometry</li> </ul> <p>Non-contact tonometry (or air-puff tonometry) is different from pneumatonometry and was invented by Bernard Grolman of Reichert, Inc (formerly American Optical). It uses a rapid air pulse to applanate (flatten) the cornea. Corneal applanation is detected via an electro-optical system. Intraocular pressure is estimated by detecting the force of the air jet at the instance of applanation.[19] Historically, non-contact tonometers were not considered to be an accurate way to measure IOP but instead a fast and simple way to screen for high IOP. However, modern non-contact tonometers have been shown to correlate well with Goldmann tonometry measurements and are particularly useful for measuring IOP in children and other non-compliant patient groups.[citation needed]</p> <ul> <li>Ocular response analyzer</li> </ul> <p>The ocular response analyser (ORA) is a non-contact (air puff) tonometer that does not require topical anaesthesia and provides additional information on the biomechanical properties of the cornea. It uses an air pulse to deform the cornea into a slight concavity. The difference between the pressures at which the cornea flattens inward and outward is measured by the machine and termed corneal hysteresis (CH). The machine uses this value to correct for the effects of the cornea on measurement.[20] In a population based study in healthy children that compared non-contact IOP measuring tonometer, including ORA and CORVIS with a contact tonometer, GAT, which is a routine instrument for IOP measurement. It was firmly evident that due to significantly low positive or negligible correlation, none of these 2 non-contact tonometers can replace the GAT.[21]</p> <p>Reference: KANSKI'S Clinical Ophthalmology, A Systematic Approach, Ninth Edition, chapter: 7, page number: 401-412</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Gaze</p> <ul> <li>MANIFEST SQUINT (HETEROTROPIA)</li> </ul> <p>In manifest squint the deviation of eye is present as such and cannot be compensated by fusion. Two main types of manifest squint are concomitant squint and paralytic squint.</p> <ol> <li>A) Concomitant squint</li> </ol> <p>In concomitant squint the eyes are not in alignment and the degree of malalignment remains constant in all the directions of gaze and there is no limitation of ocular movements. Concomitant squint may be of following types:</p> <p>1) Esotropia (Convergent squint) :- It denotes inward deviation of eye. It can be unilateral or uniocular (the same eye always deviates inwards) or alternating (either of the eyes deviates inwards and the other eye takes up fixation, alternately). Concomitant esotropia is the most common type of squint in children. Following types of esotropia are there :-</p> <ol> <li>i) Congenital esotropia (infantile esotropia)</li> </ol> <ul> <li>True congenital (infantile) esotropia usually appears between the age of 2 and 4 months. However, rarely it may be present from birth.</li> </ul> <p>The inward turn of the eye is constant of large amount, i.e., deviation is &gt; 35 prism diopters (17-5').</p> <ul> <li>Binocular vision (both eyes fixing simultaneously) does not develop.</li> </ul> <p>There is alternate fixation in primary gaze, i.e, when the infant looks straight, he fixes the gaze with one eye at a time alternately. On lateral gaze there is cross fixation, i.e, use right eye to fix across the</p> <p>nose to view the objects to the left and vice versa. Amblyopia develops in 25- 40% of cases.</p> <ul> <li>Latent horizontal nystagmus (common) and many rotatory nystagmus may occur. Inferior oblique overaction may be present initially or develop later and dissociated vertical deviation develop in 80% by age of 3 years.</li> <li>It is more difficult to help this type of strabismus with nonsurgical methods, thus, surgery is the treatment of choice. Surgical procedure to make both medial recti weak by recession. Surgery should be done as early as possible to avoid development of amblyopia and for the development of proper binocular vision. The usually recommended time is between 6 month - 2 years of age (and preferably before 1 year of age). It is important to treat the amblyopia before performing surgery by patching of normal eye.</li> </ul> <ol> <li>ii) Accommodative esotropia</li> </ol> <p>Accommodative esotropia occurs due to overaction of convergence associated with accommodation reflex. Accommodative esotropia is the most common type of squint in children (Previously it was believed that congenital esotropia is the most common type squint in children. However now it is very much clear that accommodative esotropia is the most common one). It esotropia is noted around 2-3 years of age, it is most likely accommodative esotropia. On the bases of AC/A (accommodative convergence/accomodation) ratio, accommodative esotropia is divided into two types : (a) Refractive (Normal AC/A ratio); (b) Non - refractive (abnormal AC/A ratio). AC/A ratio gives the relationship between the amount of convergence that is goverened by a given amount of accommodation.</p> <ol> <li>Normal AC/A ratio accommodative esotropia :- This occurs in children with hypermetropia. Esotropia is a physiological response to excessive hypermetropia. Patients with high hypermetropia generate large amount of accommodation to see clearly at near fixation. This excessive accommodation may cause esotropia as accommodation is associated with convergence. AC/A ratio is normal.</li> <li>Large AC/A ratio accommodative esotropia :- Children have large amounts of focusing power and sometimes the increase of accommodation is accompanied by a disproportionately large increase of convergence. This occurs in patient with hypermetropia but may occur in myopia and without any refractive error. AC/A ratio is high.</li> </ol> <p>Usually, there are no symptoms except for cosmetic embarrassment to the patient. There is no diplopia as the image in the squinting eye is automatically suppressed, i.e., amblyopia develops in squinting eye. The main feature is the failure of binocular vision.</p> <p>2) Exotropia (divergent squint) :- It is characterized by outward deviation of eye. This is very less common than esotropia.</p> <p>3) Hypertropia (Vertical squint) :- It is characterized by vertical deviation of eye. It is also rare.</p> <ol> <li>B) Incomitant squint</li> </ol> <ul> <li>Incomitant squint is a squint in which the angle of deviation differs depending upon the direction of gaze i.e, amount of deviation varies in different directions of gaze. There are many type of incomitant squints (paralytic, restrictive, 'A' &amp; 'V' pattern), however the most</li> </ul> <p>common type is Paralytic squint and the word incomitant squint is usually used for paralytic squint. Therefore, I will explain paralytic squint here Paralytic squint is the most common type of squint in adults. Paralytic squint is the strabismus resulting from complete or incomplete paralysis of one or more extraocular muscles. There are many causes like neurogenic (e.g. meningitis, cranial nerve palsy etc.), myogenic (myopathies), or neuromuscular junction lesions. O Symptoms of paralytic squint are :-</p> <ol> <li>i) Diplopia : It is the main symptom. It is most marked in the direction of action of paralysed muscle. For example in left rectus palsy, the maximum diplopia occurs when patient tries to see horizontally on left side and in left superior oblique palsy (causes Dextrodepression) diplopia is maximum when patient tries to look downward and right. It is worth noting here that in diplopia, if the images are separated horizontally it is probable that either a lateral or a medial recuts is affected; when the images are separated vertically or the image is tilted (torsion) it is likely that one or more of the vertical recti or the tilted (torsion) it is likely that one or more of the vertical recti or the obliques are affected.</li> <li>ii) Other symptoms : Confusion, nausea &amp; vertigo, ocular deviation, loss of stereopsis.</li> </ol> <p>Signs of paralytic squint are :-</p> <ol> <li>i) Secondary deviation is more than primary deviation:- Primary deviation is the deviation in the affected eye and is away from the action of paralysed muscle. Secondary deviation is the deviation of normal eye seen under cover, when the patient is made to fix with the squinting eye.</li> <li>ii) Restriction of ocular movements</li> </ol> <p>iii) Compensatory head posture :- Patients with a paralytic squint move their head such that the eyes occupy a position in the orbit where the angle of squint is minimal and this can avoid confusion and diplopia. Head is turned towards the action of paralysed muscle. When the horizontal recti (medial or lateral) are affected, the characteristic posture is a turn of the face to right or left, e.g. in left lateral rectus palsy the head is turned to the left and in left medial recuts palsy the head is turned to the right. When a vertical rectus (superior or inferior) or an oblique muscle is affected, a tilt of the head to the right or left with depression or elevation of the chin is adopted to reduce both the vertical deviation and rotation, e.g in superior oblique palsy (dextrodepression of left eye is affected) the head is tilted to left so that the left eye can see down and medially.</p> <ol> <li>iv) There is false projection or orientation</li> <li>v) There is no amblyopia and visual acuity is normal as paralytic squint develops in adults when visual acuity has already developed.</li> </ol> <p>Reference: Parsons' diseases of the eye, section 4, page number: 269-274</p>",

      "solution": "<ul> <li>Applanation tonometry</li> </ul> <p>The concept of applanation tonometry was introduced by Goldmann is 1954. It is based on Imbert- Fick lawwhich states that the pressure inside a sphere (P) is equal to the force (W) required to flatten its surface divided by the area of flattening (A); i.e., P = W/A.</p> <ul> <li>Applanation tonometry</li> </ul> <p>Applanation tonometry is based on the Imbert-Fick principle, which states that the pressure inside an ideal, dry, thin-walled sphere equals the force necessary to flatten its surface divided by the area of flattening (P = F/A, where P = pressure, F = force and A = area). In applanation tonometry, the cornea is flattened, and the IOP is determined by varying the applanating force or the area flattened. [1]</p> <ul> <li>Goldmann and Perkins applanation tonometry</li> <li>The Goldmann applanation tonometer measures the force necessary to flatten a corneal area of 3.06mm diameter. At this diameter, the resistance of the cornea to flattening is counterbalanced by the capillary attraction of the tear film meniscus for the tonometer head. The IOP (in mm Hg) equals the flattening force (in grams) multiplied by 10. Fluorescein dye is placed on the patient&rsquo;s eye to highlight the tear film. A split-image prism is used to divide the image of the tear meniscus into a superior and an inferior arc. The intraocular pressure is taken when these arcs are aligned such that their inner margins just touch.</li> <li>Applanation tonometry measurements are affected by the central corneal thickness (CCT). When Goldmann designed his tonometer, he estimated an average corneal thickness of 520 microns to cancel the opposing forces of surface tension and corneal rigidity to allow indentation. It is now known that a wide variation exists in corneal thickness among individuals. Thicker CCT may give an artificially high IOP measurement, whereas thinner CCT can give an artificially low reading.</li> <li>Other errors that may affect the accuracy of readings from a Goldmann tonometer include excessive or insufficient fluorescein in the tear film affecting the thickness of the overlapping arcs, high astigmatism, irregular or scarred cornea, pressure from a finger on the eyelid while taking the measurement, and breath holding or Valsalva maneuver by the patient during measurement.</li> <li>The Perkins tonometer is a portable Goldmann applanation tonometer that can be used with the patient in either the upright or supine positions.</li> </ul> <p>Reference: Parsons' diseases of the eye, section 4, page number: 276-281</p>",

      "solution": "<ul> <li>Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a multi-systemic genetic disorder that affects the connective tissue. Those with the condition tend to be tall and thin, with long arms, legs, fingers, and toes. They also typically have exceptionally flexible joints and abnormally curved spines.The most serious complications involve the heart and aorta, with an increased risk of mitral valve prolapse and aortic aneurysm. The lungs, eyes, bones, and the covering of the spinal cord are also commonly affected. The severity of the symptoms is variable.</li> <li>MFS is caused by a mutation in FBN1, one of the genes that makes fibrillin, which results in abnormal connective tissue. It is an autosomal dominant disorder. In about 75% of cases, it is inherited from a parent with the condition, while in about 25% it is a new mutation.Diagnosis is often based on the Ghent criteria.</li> <li>There is no known cure for MFS. Many of those with the disorder have a normal life expectancy with proper treatment.Management often includes the use of beta blockers such as propranolol or atenolol or, if they are not tolerated, calcium channel blockers or ACE inhibitors.Surgery may be required to repair the aorta or replace a heart valve. Avoiding strenuous exercise is recommended for those with the condition.</li> <li>In Marfan syndrome, the health of the eye can be affected in many ways, but the principal change is partial lens dislocation, where the lens is shifted out of its normal position.[15] This occurs because of weakness in the ciliary zonules, the connective tissue strands which suspend the lens within the eye. The mutations responsible for Marfan syndrome weaken the zonules and cause them to stretch. The inferior zonules are most frequently stretched resulting in the lens shifting upwards and outwards, but it can shift in other directions as well. Nearsightedness (myopia), and blurred vision are common due to connective tissue defects in the eye.Farsightedness can also result particularly if the lens is highly subluxated.</li> <li>Subluxation (partial dislocation) of the lens can be detected clinically in about 60% of people with Marfan syndrome by the use of a slit-lamp biomicroscope. If the lens subluxation is subtle, then imaging with high-resolution ultrasound biomicroscopy might be used.</li> <li>Other signs and symptoms affecting the eye include increased length along an axis of the globe, myopia, corneal flatness, strabismus, exotropia, and esotropia. Those with MFS are also at a high risk for early glaucoma and early cataracts.</li> </ul> <p>Reference: Parsons' diseases of the eye, section 4, page number: 321-329</p>",
