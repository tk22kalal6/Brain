Normal muscular reflexes that modulate joint movement are impaired. Without these protective mechanisms, joints are subjected to repeated trauma, resulting in progressive cartilage and bone damage. Today, diabetes mellitus is the most frequent cause of neuropathic joint disease</p><br><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0;\"src=\"https://d10ehao5y6v0v4.cloudfront.net/TestseriesNew/MedicineIX/2E.jpg\"><p>The distribution of joint involvement depends on the underlying neurologic disorder. In tabes dorsalis, the knees, hips, and ankles are most commonly affected; in syringomyelia, the glenohumeral joint, elbow, and wrist; and in diabetes mellitus, the tarsal and tarsometatarsal joints.</p><p>The pathologic changes in the neuropathic joint are similar to those found in the severe osteoarthritic joint. There is fragmentation and eventual loss of articular cartilage with eburnation of the underlying bone. Osteophytes are found at the joint margins. With more advanced disease, erosions are present on the joint surface. Fractures, devitalized bone, intraarticular loose bodies, and microscopic fragments of cartilage and bone may be present.</p><p>In the diabetic foot, may be the initial finding. With the loss of deep pain, proprioception, and protective neuromuscular reflexes, the joint is subjected to repeated microtrauma, resulting in ligamental tears and bone fractures,</p><p>Neuropathic joint disease usually begins in a single joint and then becomes apparent in other joints, depending on the underlying neurologic disorder. Neuropathic arthritis is encountered most often in patients with diabetes mellitus, with an incidence of ~0.5%. The onset of disease usually comes at an age of &ge;50 years in a patient who has had diabetes for several years, but exceptions occur. The tarsal and tarsometatarsal joints are most often affected, with the metatarsophalangeal and talotibial joints next most commonly involved. The knees and spine are occasionally involved. Downward collapse of the tarsal bones leads to convexity of the sole, referred to as a &ldquo;rocker foot.</p><p>Option A is rules out as Diabetic cheiroarthropathy or diabetic hand syndrome is one of the complications encountered in long-standing uncontrolled diabetes.

The differential diagnosis of a very high ferritin (&gt;1,000 ng/ ml) is limited to hemochromatosis, hemophagocytic syndrome, or AOSD.

It has also been described in association with Castleman's disease, lymphomas, and renal cell carcinoma, emphasizing the diagnostic importance of CT scanning to look for such tumors as well as serologic and microbiologic studies. In up to 30% of patients, AA amyloidosis can also be seen without any identifiable underlying disease. AA is the most frequent systemic amyloidosis that occurs in children.</p><p><strong>Pathology and Clinical Features </strong>Organ involvement in AA amyloidosis usually begins in the kidneys. Hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and autonomic neuropathy can also occur as the disease progresses; cardiomyopathy is a late manifestation in ~25% of patients. The symp[1]toms and signs of AA disease cannot be reliably distinguished from those of AL amyloidosis. AA amyloid fibrils are usually composed of an 8-kDa, 76-amino-acid <em>N</em>-terminal portion of the 12-kDa precursor protein SAA. This acute-phase apoprotein is synthesized in the liver and transported by high-density lipoprotein (HDL3) in the plasma. Several years of an underlying inflammatory disease causing chronic elevation of SAA levels usually precede fibril formation, although infections can lead to AA amyloid deposition more rapidly.</p><p>In hematochromatois there is elevation of the Serum ferritin level.</p><p>Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome should be suspected if a patient presents with eye and/or mouth dryness, major salivary gland enlargement, or systemic manifestations such as Raynaud's phenomenon, palpable purpura, or symptomatology of renal tubular acidosis.</p><p>Ref.Harrission's 21<sup>st</sup> edition Principles of internal medicine page no.878-886</p>",
