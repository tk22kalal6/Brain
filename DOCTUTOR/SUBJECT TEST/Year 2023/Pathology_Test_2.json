It arises from the medial wall of the cecum and averages 6&ndash;7 cm in length and 0.7 cm in greatest diameter.</li><li>The position of the appendix varies considerably; it may lie posterior to the cecum or ascending colon (its most common site), in the peri colic gutter, in front of or behind the terminal ileum, on the psoas muscle, or in the subhepatic region. The mucosa of the appendix is similar to that of the large bowel, except for a greater representation of lymphoid tissue (which is particularly prominent during adolescence). Grossly, it has a yellowish tint.</li><li>Foci of fresh haemorrhage are usually attributable to surgical trauma. Microscopically, the epithelium contains absorptive cells, goblet cells, neuroendocrine cells (mainly of Kulchitsky type and located at the base), and very few Paneth cells. Additionally, neuroendocrine cells may be detected with chromogranin or related stains within the lamina propria, unconnected with the glands, and in close association with nerves. Occasionally, these neuroendocrine cells are identifiable on routinely stained sections because of the presence of bright eosinophilic cytoplasmic granules, not to be confused with those of Paneth cells.</li><li>Most of the plasma cells present in the lamina propria are IgA producing. The sub mucosal, muscular, and serosal layers are qualitatively similar to their counterparts in the rest of the lower intestinal tract. Grossly, the serosa is smooth, glistening, and transparent. Hyperaemia of surface vessels is usually related to surgical trauma.</li><li>The mesoappendix, which is largely made up of adipose tissue, contains the appendiceal vessels. Very infrequently, one or more small lymph nodes are found within it; these drain to the pericolic and superior mesenteric nodes.</li></ul><p>Reference: (Rosai and ackerman, 10<sup>th</sup> edition,Page number 714)</p>",

Lifting of the periosteum further impairs the blood supply to the affected region, contributing to the necrosis.</li><li>The dead bone is known as a sequestrum.

Sometimes the sequestrum crumbles, releasing fragments that pass through the sinus tract.

      "solution": "<ul><li>Central penicillary arteries may show concentric intimal and smooth muscle cell hyperplasia, producing so called Onion skin lesions.</li><li>SLE is an autoimmune disease involving multiple organs, characterized by a vast array of autoantibodies, particularly antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), in which injury is caused mainly by deposition of immune complexes and binding of antibodies to various cells and tissues. Injury to the skin, joints, kidney, and serosal membranes is prominent, but virtually every organ in the body may be affected.</li></ul><p>The morphologic changes in SLE are extremely variable.</p><ul><li>The most characteristic lesions result from immune complex deposition in blood vessels, kidneys, connective tissue, and skin. Blood Vessels. An acute necrotizing vasculitis involving capillaries, small arteries, and arterioles may be present in any tissue. The arteritis leads to fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel walls. In chronic stages, vessels undergo fibrous thickening with luminal narrowing. Kidney. Up to 50% of SLE patients have clinically significant renal involvement, and the kidney virtually always shows evidence of abnormality if examined by electron microscopy and immunofluorescence.</li><li>Renal involvement takes a number of forms, all of which are associated with the deposition of immune complexes within the glomeruli.According to the currently accepted classification, six patterns of glomerular disease are recognized. It should be noted that there is overlap within these classes and that lesions may evolve from one class to another over time. Thus, the exact percentage of patients with each of the six classes of lesions is difficult to determine. Suffice it to say that class I is the least common and class IV is the most common pattern.</li><li>Skin: Characteristic erythema affects the face along the bridge of the nose and cheeks (the butterfly rash) in approximately 50% of patients, but a similar rash also may be seen on the extremities and trunk. Urticaria, bullae, maculopapular lesions, and ulcerations also occur. Exposure to sunlight incites or accentuates the erythema. Histologically the involved areas show vacuolar degeneration of the basal layer of the epidermis. In the dermis, there is variable edema and perivascular inflammation. Vasculitis with fibrinoid necrosis may be prominent. Immunofluorescence microscopy shows deposits of immunoglobulin and complement along the dermoepidermal junction; these also may be present in uninvolved skin. This finding is not diagnostic of SLE and is sometimes seen in scleroderma and dermatomyositis.</li><li>Joints: Joint involvement is typically a nonerosive synovitis with little deformity, which contrasts with rheumatoid arthritis.</li><li>Central Nervous System: Although it was suggested in the past that the neuropsychiatric manifestations of SLE may be due to acute vasculitis, in histologic studies of the nervous system in such patients, significant vasculitis is rarely present. Instead, noninflammatory occlusion of small vessels by intimal proliferation is sometimes noted, which may be due to endothelial damage caused by autoantibodies or immune complexes.</li><li>Pericarditis and Other Serosal Cavity Involvement: Inflammation of the serosal lining membranes may be acute, subacute, or chronic. During the acute phase, the mesothelial surfaces are sometimes covered with fibrinous exudate. Later they become thickened, opaque, and coated with shaggy fibrous tissue that may lead to partial or total obliteration of the serosal cavity. Pleural and pericardial effusions may be present.</li><li>Cardiovascular system: involvement may manifest as damage to any layer of the heart. Symptomatic or asymptomatic pericardial involvement is present in up to 50% of patients. Myocarditis is less common and may cause resting tachycardia and electrocardiographic abnormalities.Valvular (so-called &ldquo;LibmanSacks&rdquo;) endocarditis was more common prior to the widespread use of steroids. This sterile endocarditis takes the form of single or multiple 1- to 3-mm verrucous deposits, which may form on either surface of any heart valve, distinctively on either surface of the leaflets. By comparison, the vegetations in infective endocarditis are larger,while those in rheumatic heart disease are smaller and confined to the lines of closure of the valve leaflets. An increasing number of patients are affected by coronary artery disease manifesting as angina or myocardial infarction. This complication may be seen in young patients with longstanding disease, and is especially prevalent in those who have been treated with corticosteroids.The pathogenesis of accelerated coronary atherosclerosis is unclear but is probably multifactorial. Risk factors for atherosclerosis, including hypertension, obesity, and hyperlipidemia, are more commonly present in SLE patients than in the population at large. In addition, immune complexes and anti-phospholipid antibodies may cause endothelial damage and promote atherosclerosis. Spleen: Splenomegaly, capsular thickening, and follicular hyperplasia are common features. Central penicilliary arteries may show concentric intimal and smooth muscle cell hyperplasia, producing so-called onion-skin lesions.</li><li>Lungs: In addition to pleuritis and accompanying pleural effusions, some cases are complicated by chronic interstitial fibrosis and secondary pulmonary hypertension.</li><li>Other Organs and Tissues: LE, or hematoxylin, bodies in the bone marrow or other organs are strongly indicative of SLE. Lymph nodes may be enlarged due to hyperplasia of B cell follicles or even demonstrate necrotizing lymphadenitis due to vasculitis.</li></ul><p>Reference: (Robbins, 10<sup>th</sup><sup> edition, page number </sup>157)</p>",

At least five such mismatch repair genes have been recognized, but a majority of HNPCC cases involve either MSH2 or MLH1. Patients with HNPCC inherit one mutated DNA repair gene and one normal allele. When the second copy is lost through mutation or epigenetic silencing, defects in mismatch repair lead to the accumulation of mutations at rates up to 1000 times higher than normal, mostly in regions containing short repeating DNA sequences referred to as microsatellite DNA. The human genome contains approximately 50,000 to 100,000 microsatellites, which are prone to undergo expansion during DNA replication and represent the most frequent sites of mutations in HNPCC. The consequences of mismatch repair defects and the resulting microsatellite instability are discussed next in the context of colonic adenocarcinoma.</li></ul><p>Common Patterns of Sporadic and Familial Colorectal Neoplasia:</p><br><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0; \"src=\"https://d19tx39t2q3u48.cloudfront.net/QuizDec2022/Pathology724022023/21E.png\"><br><p>Reference: (Robbins, 10thedition, page number 630)</p>",

Serologic evidence indicates that virtually all individuals are exposed to Pneumocystis during the first few years of life, but in most the infection remains latent. Reactivation with development of clinical disease occurs almost exclusively in immunocompromised individuals. Indeed, patients with AIDS are extremely susceptible to infection with P. jiroveci, and it also may infect severely malnourished infants and immunosuppressed individuals (especially after organ transplantation or in individuals receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy or corticosteroids). In patients with AIDS, the risk for acquiring P. jiroveci infections increases in inverse proportion to the CD4+ T cell count, with counts less than 200 cells/&micro;L having a strong predictive value.

Special stains are required to visualize the organism. Silver stain of tissue sections reveals round- to cup-shaped cysts (4 to 10 &micro;m in diameter) within the alveolar exudates. The diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia should be considered in any immunocompromised patient with respiratory symptoms and abnormal findings on chest radiograph. Fever, dry cough, and dyspnea occur in 90% to 95% of patients, in whom radiographic evidence of bilateral perihilar and basilar infiltrates is typical. Hypoxia is frequent; pulmonary function studies show a restrictive lung defect. The most sensitive and effective method of diagnosis is to identify the organism in induced sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid using immunofluorescence. If treatment is initiated before widespread involvement, the outlook for recovery is good; however, because residual organisms are likely to persist, particularly in patients with AIDS, relapses are common unless the underlying immunodeficiency is corrected or prophylactic therapy is given.</p><br><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0; \"src=\"https://d19tx39t2q3u48.cloudfront.net/QuizDec2022/Pathology724022023/28E.png\"><br><p>Reference: (Robbins, 10<sup>th</sup> edition, page number - 347, 535)</p>",

Tumors that involve the hypothalamus are especially problematic because they cannot be resected completely.</li><li>Medulloblastoma occurs predominantly in children and exclusively in the cerebellum.

It is highly malignant, and the prognosis for untreated patients is dismal; however, medulloblastoma is exquisitely radiosensitive. With total excision, chemotherapy, and irradiation, the 5-year survival rate may be as high as 75%. There are a series of histologic patterns observed in medulloblastoma, which are informative about prognosis and correlate in part with the underlying genetics.</li><li>Ependymomas most often arise next to the ependymalined ventricular system, including the central canal of the spinal cord. In the first 2 decades of life, they typically occur near the fourth ventricle and constitute 5% to 10% of the primary brain tumors in this age group.

On the basis of epidemiologic studies, occupational exposure to asbestos is linked to (1) parenchymal interstitial fibrosis (asbestosis); (2) localized fibrous plaques, or, rarely, diffuse fibrosis in the pleura; (3) pleural effusions; (4) lung carcinoma; (5) malignant pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma; and (6) laryngeal carcinoma. An increased incidence of asbestos-related cancers in family members of asbestos workers has alerted the general public to the potential hazards of asbestos in the environment.</li><li>As with silica crystals, once phagocytosed by macrophages, asbestos fibers activate the inflammasome and damage phagolysosomal membranes, stimulating the release of proinflammatory factors and fibrogenic mediators. In addition to cellular and fibrotic lung reactions, asbestos probably also functions as both a tumor initiator and a promoter. Some of the oncogenic effects of asbestos on the mesothelium are mediated by reactive free radicals generated by asbestos fibers, which preferentially localize in the distal lung close to the mesothelial layer. However, potentially toxic chemicals adsorbed onto the asbestos fibers also undoubtedly contribute to the pathogenicity of the fibers. For example, the adsorption of carcinogens in tobacco smoke onto asbestos fibers may be the basis for the remarkable synergy between tobacco smoking and the development of lung carcinoma in asbestos workers.</li></ul><p>Reference: (Robbins, 10<sup>th</sup> edition, page number - 198, 309, 511)</p>",

      "solution": "<ul><li>Crohn disease, also known as regional enteritis, may occur in any area of the gastrointestinal tract but the most common sites involved at presentation are the terminal ileum, ileocecal valve, and cecum. Disease is limited to the small intestine alone in about 40% of cases; the small intestine and the colon both are involved in 30% of patients; and the remainder of cases are characterized by colonic involvement only. Infrequently, Crohn disease may involve the esophagus or stomach.The presence of multiple, separate, sharply delineated areas of disease, resulting in skip lesions, is characteristic of Crohn disease and may help in differentiation from ulcerative colitis. Strictures are common.</li><li>The earliest lesion, the aphthous ulcer, may progress, and multiple lesions often coalesce into elongated, serpentine ulcers oriented along the axis of the bowel. Edema and loss of normal mucosal folds are common. Sparing of interspersed mucosa results in a coarsely textured, cobblestone appearance in which diseased tissue is depressed below the level of normal mucosa.Fissures frequently develop between mucosal folds and may extend deeply to become sites of perforation or fistula tracts. The intestinal wall is thickened as a consequence of transmural edema, inflammation, submucosal fibrosis, and hypertrophy of the muscularis propria, all of which contribute to stricture formation. In cases with extensive transmural disease, mesenteric fat frequently extends around the serosal surface (creeping fat).</li><li>The microscopic features of active Crohn disease include abundant neutrophils that infiltrate and damage crypt epithelium. Clusters of neutrophils within a crypt are referred to as a crypt abscess and often are associated with crypt destruction. Ulceration is common in Crohn disease, and there may be an abrupt transition between ulcerated and normal mucosa. Repeated cycles of crypt destruction and regeneration lead to distortion of mucosal architecture; the normally straight and parallel crypts take on bizarre branching shapes and unusual orientations to one another. Epithelial metaplasia, another consequence of chronic relapsing injury, often takes the form of gastric antral-appearing glands (pseudopyloric metaplasia). Paneth cell metaplasia may occur in the left colon, where Paneth cells are normally absent. These architectural and metaplastic changes may persist, even when active inflammation has resolved. Mucosal atrophy, with loss of crypts, may follow years of disease. Noncaseating granulomas a hallmark of Crohn disease, are found in approximately 35% of cases and may arise in areas of active disease or uninvolved regions in any layer of the intestinal wall. Granulomas also may be found in mesenteric lymph nodes. Cutaneous granulomas form nodules that are referred to (misleadingly) as metastatic Crohn disease. The absence of granulomas does not preclude a diagnosis of Crohn disease.</li></ul><br><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0; \"src=\"https://d19tx39t2q3u48.cloudfront.net/QuizDec2022/Pathology724022023/35E.png\"><br><p>Noncaseating Granuloma in Crohn&rsquo;s disease.</p><p>Reference: (Robbins, 10<sup>th</sup> edition, Page number 623)</p>",

      "solution": "<ul><li>Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutation of the ATP7B gene, which results in impaired copper excretion into bile and a failure to incorporate copper into ceruloplasmin. This disorder is marked by the accumulation of toxic levels of copper in many tissues and organs, principally the liver, brain, and eye. Normally, 40% to 60% of ingested copper (2&ndash;5 mg/day) is absorbed in the duodenum and proximal small intestine, from where it is transported complexed with albumin and histidine to the liver. Here, free copper dissociates and is taken up by hepatocytes, where copper is incorporated into enzymes and &alpha;2-globulin (apoceruloplasmin) to form ceruloplasmin, which is secreted into the blood. Ceruloplasmin carries 90% to 95% of plasma copper. Circulating ceruloplasmin is eventually desialylated, endocytosed by the liver, and degraded within lysosomes, after which the released copper is excreted into bile. This degradation/excretion pathway is the primary route for copper elimination.</li><li>The ATP7B gene, located on chromosome 13, encodes a transmembrane copper-transporting ATPase that is expressed on the hepatocyte canalicular membrane. The overwhelming majority of patients with Wilson disease are compound heterozygotes with different loss-of-function mutations affecting each ATP7B allele. The overall frequency of mutated alleles is 1: 100, and the prevalence of the disease is approximately 1:30,000 to 1 :50,000. Loss of ATP7B protein function impairs the transport of copper into the bile and the incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin, which is not secreted in its apoceruloplasmin form. These abnormalities lead to copper accumulation in the liver and a decrease in plasma ceruloplasmin.</li><li>Accumulating copper causes liver injury through the production of reactive oxygen species by the Fenton reaction (Chapter 3). Eventually, non-ceruloplasmin&ndash;bound copper is released from injured hepatocytes into the circulation, causing red cell hemolysis and allowing copper to deposit in other tissues, such as the brain, corneas, kidneys, bones, joints, and parathyroid glands. Concomitantly, urinary excretion of copper increases markedly from its normal minuscule levels.</li><li>Morphology: The liver often bears the brunt of injury.The hepatic changes are variable, ranging from relatively minor to massive and mimic many other disease processes.There may be mild to moderate fatty change (steatosis) associated with focal hepatocyte necrosis. Acute, fulminant hepatitis can mimic acute viral hepatitis.</li><li>Chronic hepatitis in Wilson disease exhibits moderate to severe inflammation and hepatocyte necrosis, areas of fatty change, and features of steatohepatitis (hepatocyte ballooning with prominent Mallory-Denk bodies). In advanced cases, cirrhosis may be seen. Copper deposition in hepatocytes can be demonstrated by special stains (rhodamine stain for copper, orcein stain for copper-associated protein). Toxic injury to the brain primarily affects the basal ganglia. Nearly all patients with neurologic involvement develop eye lesions called Kayser-Fleischer rings, green to brown deposits of copper in Des&ccedil;emet membrane in the limbus of the cornea.</li><li>Clinical features: The age at onset and the clinical presentation of Wilson disease are extremely variable. Symptoms usually appear between 6 and 40 years of age. Acute or chronic liver disease are common presenting features. Neuropsychiatric manifestations are the initial features in most of the remaining cases and stem from deposition of copper in the basal ganglia. The diagnosis of Wilson disease is based on low levels of serum ceruloplasmin, an increase in hepatic copper content (the most sensitive test), and increased urinary excretion of copper (the most specific test). Hepatic copper content in excess of 250 &micro;g per gram dry weight of liver is taken to be diagnostic, but is only about 80% sensitive. In those with lower liver copper levels, the diagnosis depends on other abnormalities, such as elevated urinary copper, low serum ceruloplasmin, and the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings. Unlike hereditary hemochromatosis, where the limited number of genetic variants makes genetic testing fairly simple, the large number of different causative mutations in ATP7B7 complicates the use of DNA sequencing as a diagnostic test. Serum copper levels also are of no diagnostic value, as they may be low, normal, or elevated, depending on the stage of the liver disease.</li></ul><p>Reference: (Robbins, 10<sup>th</sup> edition, Page number 657)</p>",

The retinoblastoma gene (RB) was the first tumor suppressor gene to be discovered and is now considered the prototype of this family of cancer genes. As with many advances in medicine, the discovery of tumor suppressor genes was accomplished by the study of a rare disease&mdash;in this case, retinoblastoma, an uncommon childhood tumor.</li><li>Approximately 60% of retinoblastomas are sporadic, while the remaining ones are familial, the predisposition to develop the tumor being transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. To account for the sporadic and familial occurrence of an identical tumor, Knudson, in 1974, proposed his now famous two-hit hypothesis, which in molecular terms can be stated as follows: &bull; Two mutations (hits) are required to produce retinoblastoma. These involve the RB gene, which has been mapped to chromosomal locus 13q14. Both of the normal alleles of the RB locus must be inactivated (hence the two hits) for the development of retinoblastoma.</li><li>In familial cases, children inherit one defective copy of the RB gene in the germ line; the other copy is normal Retinoblastoma develops when the normal RB gene is lost in retinoblasts as a result of somatic mutation. Because in retinoblastoma families a single germ line mutation is sufficient to transmit disease risk, the trait has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. &bull; In sporadic cases, both normal RB alleles are lost by somatic mutation in one of the retinoblasts. The end result is the same: a retinal cell that has lost both of the normal copies of the RB gene becomes cancerous.</li><li>From the above, it is evident that although the risk for developing retinoblastoma in retinoblastoma families is inherited as a dominant trait, at the level of the cell, one intact RB gene is all that is needed for normal function. Although the loss of normal RB genes initially was discovered in retinoblastomas, it is now evident that biallelic loss of this gene is a fairly common feature of several tumors, including breast cancer, small cell cancer of the lung, and bladder cancer. Patients with familial retinoblastoma also are at greatly increased risk for developing osteosarcomas and some soft-tissue sarcomas.</li></ul><p>Reference: (Robbins, 10<sup>th</sup> edition, Page number 208)</p>",

Moreover, the epithelial cells in PanINs show dramatic telomere shortening, potentially predisposing these lesions to pathogenic chromosomal abnormalities that may contribute to acquisition of the full spectrum of cancer hallmarks.

Telomeres are short repeated sequences of DNA present at the ends of chromosomes that are important for ensuring the complete replication of chromosome ends and for protecting the ends from fusion and degradation.</li><li>Telomeric DNA also binds proteins that shield it, preventing activation of a DNA damage response. When somatic cells replicate, a small section of the telomere is not duplicated, and telomeres become progressively shortened. As they shorten, the ends of chromosomes cannot be protected and are sensed in cells as broken DNA, which signals cell cycle arrest. Telomere length is maintained by nucleotide addition mediated by an enzyme called telomerase.</li><li>Telomerase is a specialized RNA-protein complex that uses its own RNA as a template for adding nucleotides to the ends of chromosomes. Telomerase is expressed in germ cells and is present at low levels in stem cells, but absent in most somatic cells. Therefore, as mature somatic cells age, their telomeres become shorter and they exit the cell cycle, resulting in an inability to generate new cells to replace damaged ones. Conversely, in immortalized cancer cells, telomerase is usually reactivated and telomere length is stabilized, allowing the cells to proliferate indefinitely. This is discussed more fully in Chapter 6.</li><li>Telomere shortening also may decrease the regenerative capacity of stem cells, further contributing to cellular aging. Despite such alluring observations, however, the relationship of telomerase activity and telomere length to aging has yet to be fully established. Abnormalities in telomere maintenance have been implicated in many diseases, such as aplastic anemia and other cytopenias (thought to be caused by a failure of hematopoietic stem cells), premature greying of hair, skin pigment and nail abnormalities, pulmonary and liver fibrosis, and others These disorders are sometimes considered the prototypic &ldquo;telomeropathies.&rdquo;</li></ul><p>Reference: (Robbins, 10<sup>th</sup> edition, Page number 54)</p>",
