The electrocardiogram leads are usually more helpful in localizing regions of ST elevation than non-ST elevation ischemia. For example, acute transmural anterior (including apical and lateral) wall ischemia is reflected by ST elevations or increased T wave positivity in one or more of the precordial leads (V1&ndash;V6) and leads I and aVL. Inferior wall ischemia produces changes in leads II, III, and aVF. &ldquo;Posterior&rdquo; wall ischemia (usually associated with lateral or inferior involvement) may be indirectly recognized by reciprocal ST depressions in leads V1&ndash;V3 (thus constituting an ST elevation &ldquo;equivalent&rdquo; acute coronary syndrome). Right ventricular ischemia usually produces ST elevations in right-sided chest leads.

      "solution": "<p>Tumor lysis syndrome occurs most commonly in individuals undergoing chemotherapy for rapidly proliferating malignancies, including acute leukemias and Burkitt lymphoma. In rare instances, it can be seen in chronic lymphoma or solid tumors. As the chemotherapeutic agents act on these cells, there is massive tumor lysis that results in release of intracellular ions and nucleic acids. This leads to a characteristic metabolic syndrome of hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia. Acute kidney injury is frequent and can lead to renal failure requiring hemodialysis if uric acid crystallizes within the renal tubules. Lactic acidosis and dehydration increase the risk of acute kidney injury. Hyperphosphatemia occurs due to the release of intracellular phosphate ions and causes a reciprocal reduction in serum calcium. The hypocalcemia can be profound, leading to neuromuscular irritability and tetany. Hyperkalemia can become rapidly life-threatening and cause ventricular arrhythmia. Knowing the characteristics of tumor lysis syndrome, one can attempt to prevent the known complications from occurring. It is important to monitor serum electrolytes frequently during treatment. Laboratory studies should be obtained no less than three times daily, but more frequent monitoring is often needed. Allopurinol should be administered prophylactically at high doses. If allopurinol fails to control uric acid to less than 8 mg/dL, rasburicase, a recombinant urate oxidase, can be added at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg. Throughout this period, the patient should be intravenously well hydrated with alkalinization of the urine to a pH of greater than 7.0. Prophylactic hemodialysis is not performed unless there is underlying renal failure prior to starting chemotherapy.</p><p>Reference: Harrison&rsquo;s Principles of Internal Medicine 21<sup>st</sup> edition Ch:75 Pg:573</p>",

      "solution": "<p>The smear demonstrates elongated and crescent-shaped red blood cells typical of sickle cell disease. Target cells and a nucleated red blood cell are also seen. The sickle cell syndromes are caused by a mutation in the &beta;-globin gene that changes the sixth amino acid from glutamic acid to valine. HbS (&alpha;2&beta;26 Glu&rarr;Val) polymerizes reversibly when deoxygenated to form a gelatinous network of fibrous polymers that stiffen the red blood cell membrane, increase viscosity, and cause dehydration due to potassium leakage and calcium influx . These changes also produce the sickle shape. The thalassemia syndromes are inherited disorders of &alpha;- or &beta;-globin biosynthesis. Mutations causing thalassemia can affect any step in the pathway of globin gene expression: transcription, processing of the mRNA precursor, translation, and posttranslational metabolism of the &beta;-globin polypeptide chain. The most common forms arise from mutations that derange splicing of the mRNA precursor or prematurely terminate translation of the mRNA. The four classic &alpha; thalassemias, most common in Asians, are &alpha; thalassemia-2 trait, in which one of the four &alpha;-globin loci is deleted; &alpha; thalassemia-1 trait, with two deleted loci; HbH disease, with three loci deleted; and hydrops fetalis with Hb Barts, with all four loci deleted. Nondeletion forms of &alpha; thalassemia also exist. The two most important acquired hemoglobinopathies are carbon monoxide poisoning and methemoglobinemia. Carbon monoxide has a higher affinity to hemoglobin than does oxygen; it can replace oxygen and diminish O2 delivery. Chronic elevation of carboxyhemoglobin levels to 10 or 15%, as occurs in smokers, can lead to secondary polycythemia. Carboxyhemoglobin is cherry red in color and masks the development of cyanosis usually associated with poor O2 delivery to tissues.</p><p>Reference: Harrison&rsquo;s Principles of Internal Medicine 21<sup>st</sup> edition Ch:98 Pg:757-759</p>",

      "solution": "<p>The peripheral blood smear shows bite cells (arrow), anisocytosis, and spherocytes. The combination of the peripheral smear, jaundice, and hyperbilirubinemia 1 day after receiving sulfamethoxazole makes glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency most likely. G6PD deficiency is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical parts of the world (Africa, southern Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Oceania) and wherever people from those areas have migrated. A conservative estimate is that at least 400 million people have a G6PD deficiency gene. In several of these areas, the frequency of a G6PD deficiency gene may be as high as 20% or more. The G6PD gene is X-linked; thus, males have only one G6PD gene (i.e., they are hemizygous for this gene). Therefore, they must be either normal or G6PD deficient. Hemolytic anemia in patients with G6PD deficiency can develop as a result of fava beans, infections, and drugs. Common drugs include primaquine, dapsone, sulfamethoxazole, and nitrofurantoin. Typically, a hemolytic attack starts with malaise, weakness, and abdominal or lumbar pain. After an interval of several hours to 2&ndash;3 days, the patient develops jaundice and often dark urine. The onset can be extremely abrupt, especially with favism in children. There may be hemoglobinemia, hemoglobinuria, high lactate dehydrogenase, and low or absent plasma haptoglobin. G6PD deficiency may be diagnosed by semi quantitative or quantitative red blood cell tests or by DNA testing. Hemolytic-uremic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura cause microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with prominent schistocytes.

Histologic examination of the urticarial lesion would demonstrate mast cell degranulation with edema of the dermis and subcutaneous tissues. In experimental exposure to a cold challenge such as an ice water bath, elevated levels of histamine in venous blood may be demonstrated if assessed in the extremity exposed to a cold environment, whereas the histamine levels would be normal in a non exposed extremity. The appearance of a linear wheal after a firm stroke is indicative of dermatographism. This condition can be seen in 1&ndash;4% of the population and is often found in individuals with cold urticaria. In general, cold urticaria is a localized process without adverse consequences. However, vascular collapse may occur if an individual is submerged in cold water. In this patient, there is a clear precipitant for developing urticaria&mdash;cold exposure.

Clinical practice guidelines indicate that the addition of an H2 antagonist such as ranitidine or famotidine in conventional dosages and a CysLT1 receptor antagonist, such as montelukast 10 mg daily or zafirlukast 20 mg twice a day, may add benefit when H1 antihistamines are inadequate. For chronic urticaria that has failed to respond to the above combinations, monoclonal anti-IgE antibodies such as omalizumab are now the next line of therapy. Older agents with antihistamine properties such as doxepin, cyproheptadine, and hydroxyzine have proven effective when H1 antihistamines fail but are less effective than omalizumab and are sedating.</p><p>Topical glucocorticoids are of no value, and systemic glucocorticoids are generally avoided in idiopathic, allergen-induced, or physical urticarias due to their long-term toxicity.</p><p>Reference: Harrison&rsquo;s Principles of Internal Medicine 21<sup>st</sup> edition Ch:352 Pg:2723</p>",

Consequently, an IGF-1 level provides a useful laboratory screening measure when clinical features raise the possibility of acromegaly.

The diagnosis of acromegaly is confirmed by demonstrating the failure of GH suppression to &lt;0.4 &mu;g/L within 1&ndash;2 h of an oral glucose load (75 g). When ultrasensitive GH assays are used, normal nadir GH levels are even lower (&lt;0.05 &mu;g/L). About 20% of patients exhibit a paradoxical GH rise after glucose. PRL should be measured, as it is elevated in ~25% of patients with acromegaly. Thyroid function, gonadotropins, and sex steroids may be attenuated because of tumor mass effects.

The neurologic manifestations of Wilson disease typically occur in patients in their early 20s, although the age of onset extends into the sixth decade of life. MRI and CT scans reveal damage in the basal ganglia and occasionally in the pons, medulla, thalamus, cerebellum, and subcortical areas. The three main movement disorders include dystonia, incoordination, and tremor. Dysarthria and dysphagia are common. In some patients, the clinical picture closely resembles that of Parkinson disease. Dystonia can involve any part of the body and eventually leads to grotesque positions of the limbs, neck, and trunk. Autonomic disturbances may include orthostatic hypotension and sweating abnormalities as well as bowel, bladder, and sexual dysfunction. Memory loss, migraine-type headaches, and seizures may occur. Patients have difficulty focusing on tasks, but cognition usually is not grossly impaired. Sensory abnormalities and muscular weakness are not features of the disease. Half of patients with neurologic disease have a history of behavioral disturbances with onset in the 5 years before diagnosis. The features are diverse and may include loss of emotional control (temper tantrums, crying bouts), depression, hyperactivity, or loss of sexual inhibition. Some female patients have repeated spontaneous abortions, and most become amenorrheic prior to diagnosis. Cholelithiasis and nephrolithiasis occur with increased frequency. Some patients have osteoarthritis, particularly of the knee. Microscopic hematuria is common, and levels of urinary excretion of phosphates, amino acids, glucose, or urates may increase; however, a full-blown Fanconi syndrome is rare. Sunflower cataracts and Kayser-Fleischer rings (copper deposits in the outer rim of the cornea) may be seen. Electrocardiographic and other cardiac abnormalities have been reported but are not common.</p><p>Reference: Harrison&rsquo;s Principles of Internal Medicine 21<sup>st</sup> edition Ch:415 Pg:3235-3236</p>",

Which of his symptoms would mostly improve with the addition of supplemental testosterone?</span></p>",

      "solution": "<p>Several epidemiologic studies, such as the Framingham Heart Study, the European Male Ageing Study (EMAS), and the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures in Men that used mass spectrometry for measuring testosterone levels have reported ~10% prevalence of low testosterone levels in middle-aged and older men; the prevalence of unequivocally low testosterone and sexual symptoms in men aged 40&ndash;70 years in the EMAS was 2.1%, and increased with age from 0.1% for men aged 40&ndash;49 years of age to 5.1% for those aged 70&ndash;79 years. The age-related decline in testosterone should be distinguished from classical hypogonadism due to diseases of the testes, the pituitary, and the hypothalamus. An analysis of signs and symptoms in older men in the EMAS revealed a syndromic association of sexual symptoms with total testosterone levels below 320 ng/dL and free testosterone levels below 64 pg/mL in community-dwelling older men. A series of placebo-controlled testosterone trials have provided important information about the efficacy of testosterone in improving outcomes in older men. Testosterone replacement in older men, aged &ge;65, with sexual symptoms improved sexual activity, sexual desire, and erectile function more than placebo. Testosterone replacement did not improve fatigue or cognitive function, and had only a small effect on mood and mobility. Among older men with low testosterone and age-associated memory impairment, testosterone replacement did not improve memory or other measures of cognition relative to placebo. Testosterone replacement was associated with significantly greater increase in vertebral as well as femoral volumetric bone mineral density and estimated bone strength relative to placebo.</p><p>Testosterone replacement was associated with a greater increase in hemoglobin levels and corrected anemia in a greater proportion of men who had unexplained anemia of aging.</p><p>Reference: Harrison&rsquo;s Principles of Internal Medicine 21<sup>st</sup> edition Ch:391 Pg:3019</p>",
