(i.e. Furosemide)</p><p><strong>Furosemide</strong></p><p>The major site of action is the thick ascending limb of loop of henle (TAL), therefore, called <em>loop diuretics</em>. Furosemide inhibits Na+- K+-2Cl-cotransport.</p><p>It is secreted in PT by organic anion transport and reaches TAL where it acts from luminal side of the membrane. The corticomedullary osmotic gradient is abolished and positive as well as negative free water clearance is blocked.</p><p>In addition to its prominent tubular action, furosemide causes acute changes in renal and systemic haemodynamics. After 5 min of i.v. injection, renal blood flow is transiently increased and there is redistribution of blood flow from outer to midcortical zone; g.f.r. generally remains unaltered due to compensatory mechanisms despite increased total renal blood flow. The intrarenal haemodynamic changes are brought about by increased local PG synthesis Intravenous furosemide causes prompt increase in systemic venous capacitance which decreases left ventricular filling pressure, even before the saluretic response is apparent. This action also appears to be PG mediated and is responsible for the quick relief it affords in LVF and pulmonary edema.</p><p>Reference: Essentials of Medical Pharmacology by KD Tripathi, 8<sup>th</sup> edition, page no. 626-627</p>",
