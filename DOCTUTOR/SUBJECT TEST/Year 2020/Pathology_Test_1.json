Because of the wall thinning that accompanies dilation, the ventricular thickness may be less than, equal to, or greater than normal. Mural thrombi are often present and may be a source of thromboemboli. By definition, valvular and vascular lesions (e.g., atherosclerotic coronary artery disease) that can cause cardiac dilation secondarily are absent. The characteristic histologic abnormalities in DCM are nonspecific. Most myocytes exhibit hypertrophy with enlarged nuclei, but many are attenuated, stretched, and irregular. There is also variable interstitial and endocardial fibrosis, with scattered areas of replacement fibrosis; the latter mark previous myocyte ischemic necrosis caused by hypoperfusion, or they may be the footprints of a previous 'missed' myocarditis.</p><p>(A) Fusion, thickening, and shortening of the chordae tendineae of the mitral valve is characteristic of chronic Rheumatic heart disease.</p><p>(C) Thick interventricular septum is seen in valvular degeneration.</p><p>(D) Severe coronary artery atherosclerosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery is not matching the history of cardiomyopathy.</p><p>Reference: Robbins Basic Pathology, 10<sup>th</sup> ed, Pg- 423, 425, 429</p>",

The likelihood of an underlying anatomic abnormality contributing to the development of pneumonia is a strong possibility. Extralobar pulmonary sequestra-tion is a mass outside of the lung not connected to the bronchi. However, the condition usually presents early in life, even at the age of one day, because of difficulty breathing (A). Intralobar sequestration is a mass of pulmonary parenchyma, also not connected to the bronchi, which is most commonly found in the lower lobes and causes recurring episodes of pneu- monia. The X-ray supports an intralobar pulmonary sequestration (B). Given the past history of episodes of pneumonia, a simple lobar pneumonia is unlikely (C).

      "solution": "<p>Major clinical feature of longstanding productive cough in this adult male smoker for 25 years is due to chronic bronchitis, which over a period of many years, has led to bronchiectasis and hence foul smelling expectoration for so many years. Interspersed haemoptysis can occur in bronchiectasis due to bleeding of friable inflamed mucosa although it requires further investigations to rule out lung cancer. Two earlier episodes of pneumonia are due to bacterial infections causing consolidation which are common in such patients. His current presenting feature of fever is also due to bacterial infection of the lung parenchyma. Shortness of breath and increased respiratory rate are due to impaired pulmonary function from damaged lung parenchyma in COPD. Rhonchi and crepitations reflect damaged airways containing secretions. Clubbing of fingers is due to chronic hypoxia for many years. Weight loss and anaemia are due to systemic features of chronic infection; mild icterus is owing to mild liver dysfunction. Pedal oedema is due to hypoproteinaemia which could be due to proteinuria since long-standing chronic infectious and destructive condition like bronchiectasis can cause secondary amyloidosis.</p><p>Reference: Robbins Basic Pathology, 10<sup>th</sup> ed, Pg- 61,465</p>",
