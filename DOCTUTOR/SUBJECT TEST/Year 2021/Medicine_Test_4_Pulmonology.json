      "solution": "<p><strong>Chest CT </strong>High-resolution CT (HRCT) chest imaging is now considered to be standard of care in the initial evaluation of a patient with a suspected ILD. HRCT can be diagnostic for some ILDs (e.g., IPF) in the right clinical context and may preclude the need for, and spare the patient the risk of, a lung biopsy. HRCT also helps to define the extent of the ILD, determine the presence of more concerning features suggestive of advanced disease (e.g., honeycombing), provide information on coexisting diseases (e.g., emphysema and lung cancer), and when not diagnostic, provide the most useful locations for obtaining lung biopsy specimens</p><p>IPF is the most common ILD of unknown cause. Prevalence increases with age and is estimated at 50-200:100,000. IPF is commonly diagnosed in the fifth or sixth decade in life, affects men more than women, and is frequently associated with a history of smoking or other environmental exposures. IPF is a variably progressive disease that carries a poor prognosis with an estimated 50% 3- to 5-year survival.Chest CT findings include subpleural reticulation with a posterior basal predominance usually including more advanced fibrotic features, such as honeycombing and traction bronchiectasis. Collectively, these imaging findings are referred to as a UIP pattern.</p><p>Historically, IPF was felt to be refractory to medical therapy with lung transplantation the only viable therapeutic option. This dogma changed in 2014 with large clinical trials that demonstrated that antifibrotic therapy (pirfenidone and nintedanib) can slow decline of lung function in IPF patients. Further meta-analyses have suggested that antifibrotic therapy may also improve survival. Trials now suggest that antifibrotic therapy may be broadly effective in other forms of progressive pulmonary fibrosis as well.</p><p>Ref.Harrision's 21<sup>st</sup> edition Principles of internal medicine Page No.2193</p>",
