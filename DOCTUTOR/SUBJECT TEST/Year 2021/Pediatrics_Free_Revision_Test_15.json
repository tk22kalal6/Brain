According to Nelson 21<sup>st</sup> Ed, the normal clearance of fetal lung fluid occurs through increased expression of epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) and sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na+, K+ -ATPase) that drive active sodium (and thereby fluid) reabsorption. TTN is believed to result from ineffective expression or activity of ENaC and Na+, K+ -ATPase, which slows absorption of fetal lung fluid and results in decreased pulmonary compliance and impeded gas exchange.</p>",
