Mostly the underlying cause is a duct papilloma or duct ectasia, but since the chances of malignancy are high, it must be investigated further. the risk of malignancy increases if an underlying mass is present. Investigation used are Mammography - can show any underlying suspicious lesion Cytological examination - this may identify malignant cells, but a negative finding does not rule out cancer. Galactography/Ductography The primary indication for ductography is nipple discharge, particularly when bloody. Ductography though helpful in reaching a diagnosis is not essential since excision of the bloody duct system is indicated regardless of finding. In this study, a contrast medium is injected into the discharging duct and a mammogram taken. The injected may show an intraductal papilloma as a filling defect surrounded by contrast. Cancers may appear as irregular masses or as multiple intraluminal filling defects, or abrupt obstruction. Duct ectasia or fibrocystic disease may appear as dilated cystic structures Ultrasound - may show the presence of an underlying mass or duct ectasia. The final diagnosis is made by excising the involved duct (Microdochotomy) and any underlying mass if present and subjecting them for a histopathological diagnosis. Radical duct excision (meaning removal of all lacticiferous ducts) is not done.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>The only firm contraindication to wide excision and radiation (breast preservation, lumpectomy) as the primary surgical treatment for a newly discovered breast cancer is the inability to achieve an uninvolved surgical margin after excision of the tumor. A positive surgical margin requires, at least, reoperation with an attempt at re-excision of cancer. If the margin of removal is positive after attempts at re-excision, this is a strong reason to recommend mastectomy in preference to breast conservation. Tumor size is a relative contraindication when the cancer is so large in relation to the breast that excision to a clean surgical margin seems unreasonable. Other histologic findings, such as tumor grade or vascular invasion, are not strong reasons to recommend a mastectomy if the patient would prefer breast conservation.</p>",
