India was in this stage till 1920.</li><li>SECOND STAGE (Early expanding) The death rate begins to decline, while the birth rate remains unchanged. Many countries in South Asia, and Africa are in this phase. Birth rates have increased in some of these countries possibly as a result of improved health conditions, and shortening periods of breast-feeding.</li><li>THIRD STAGE (Late expanding) The death rate declines still further, and the birth rate tends to fall. The population continues to grow because births exceed deaths. India has entered this phase. In a number of developing countries (e.g., China, Singapore) birth rates have declined rapidly.</li><li>FOURTH STAGE (Low stationary) This stage is characterized by a low birth and low death rate with the result that the population becomes stationary. Zero population growth has already been recorded in Austria during 1980-85. Growth rates as little as 0.1 were recorded in UK, Denmark, Sweden and Belgium during 1980-85.</li></ol>",
