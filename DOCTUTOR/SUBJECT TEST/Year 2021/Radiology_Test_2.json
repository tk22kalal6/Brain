US and MR elastrography are now undergoing evaluation for their ability to detect different degrees of hepatic fibrosis and to obviate the need for liver biopsy in assessing disease stage. If found to be reliable, hepatic elastography may be an appropriate means of monitoring fibrosis and disease progression. With CT elastrography is not practically possible.</p><p><strong>Noninvasive Tests to Detect Hepatic Fibrosis </strong>Although liver biopsy is the standard for the assessment of hepatic fibrosis, noninvasive measures of hepatic fibrosis have been developed and show promise. These measures include multiparameter tests aimed at detecting and staging the degree of hepatic fibrosis and imaging techniques.</p><ul><li>FibroTest is the best evaluated of the multiparameter blood tests. The test incorporates haptoglobin, bilirubin, GGT, apolipoprotein A-I, and alpha-2-macroglobulin and has been found to have high positive and negative predictive values for diagnosing advanced fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C, chronic hepatitis B, and alcoholic liver disease and patients taking methotrexate for psoriasis.</li></ul><p>Transient elastography (TE), marketed as FibroScan, and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) both have gained U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for use in the management of patients with liver disease. TE uses ultrasound waves to measure hepatic stiffness noninvasively. TE has been shown to be accurate for identifying advanced fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C, primary biliary cirrhosis, hemochromatosis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and recurrent chronic hepatitis after liver transplantation. MRE has been found to be superior to TE for staging liver fibrosis in patients with a variety of chronic liver diseases, but requires access to a magnetic resonance imaging scanner</p>",

The vast majority of rolling hernias are mixed hernias in which the cardia is displaced into the chest and the greater curve of the stomach rolls into the mediastinum. Sometimes, the whole of the stomach lies in the chest-Colon or small intestine may sometimes lie in the hernia sac. The hernia is most common in the elderly, but may occur in young fit people. As the stomach rolls up into the chest, there is always an element of rotation (volvulus).</p><p>The symptoms of rolling hernia are mostly due to twisting and distortion of the oesophagus and stomach. Dysphagia is common. Chest pain may occur from distension of an obstructed stomach. Classically, the pain is relieved by a loud belch.</p><p>Symptoms of GIRD are variable. Strangulation, gastric perforation and gangrene can occur. Emergency presentation with any of these complications carries high mortality on account of a combination of late diagnosis, generally elderly patients with comorbid diseases and the complexity of surgery involved.</p><p>The hernia may be visible on a plain radiograph of the chest as a gas bubble, often with a fluid level behind the heart. A barium meal is the best method of diagnosis. The endoscopic appearances may be confusing, especially in large hernias when it is easy to become disorientated.</p><p>Symptomatic rolling hernias nearly always require surgical repair as they are potentially dangerous. The risk of an asymptomatic patient developing a significant problem when a rolling hiatus hernia is discovered incidentally has probably been overestimated in the past. The annual risk is probably no more than 1 per cent. Patients who present as an emergency with acute chest pain may be treated initially by nasogastric tube to relieve the distension that causes the pain, followed by operative repair.</p><p>If the pain is not relieved or perforation is suspected, immediate operation is mandatory</p>",

A typical ultrasound contrast agent consists of a thin flexible or rigid shell composed of albumin, lipid, or polymer confining a gas such as nitrogen, or a perfluorocarbon. The sonogram image quality is improved either by decreasing the reflectivity of the undesired interfaces or by increasing the backscattered echoes from the desired regions.

The heavy-metal element gadolinium forms the basis of all currently approved intravenous MR contrast agents. Gadolinium is a paramagnetic substance, which means that it reduces the T1 and T2 relaxation times of nearby water protons, resulting in a high signal on T1W images and a low signal on T2W images. Although MRA is usually done without gadolinium injection, it's use helps to detect lesions with abnormal vascularity in the brain, spine, and other organs with more sensitivity and specificity and in more finer visualisation of the vessels.</li><li>There is no contrast agent by name ultragrafin</li></ul>",
