      "solution": "<p>S.320, I.P.C. :</p><p>GRIEVOUS HURT :</p><p>Any of the following injuries are grievous.</p><p>(1) Emasculation.</p><p>(2) Permanent privation of sight of either eye.</p><p>(3) Permanent privation of hearing of either ear.</p><p>(4) Privation of any member or joint.</p><p>(5) Destruction or permanent impairing of the power of any member or joint.</p><p>(6) Permanent disfiguration of the head or face.</p><p>(7) Fracture or dislocation of a bone or tooth.</p><p>(8) Any hurt which endangers life, or which causes the victim to be in severe bodily pain, or unable to follow his ordinary pursuits for a period of twenty days.</p><p>COMMENT : Grievous hurt is hurt of a more serious nature. It is very difficult to draw a line between those bodily hurts which are serious and those which are slight. To make out the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, there must be some specific hurt, voluntarily inflicted, and coming within any of the eight kinds enumerated in this section.</p><p>Any hurt which causes the victim to be in severe bodily pain, or unable to follow his ordinary pursuits for a period of 20 days : The length of time during which a sufferer is in pain, disease or incapacitated from pursuing his ordinary occupation is a defective criterion of the severity of a hurt. It is employed not only in cases where violence has been used, but also in cases where hurt has been caused without any assault, e.g., by the administration of drugs, the setting of traps, the digging of pitfalls, the placing of ropes across a road, etc. The extent of hurt and the intention of the offender are considered for giving punishment. It is difficult to prove that an injured person was in severe bodily pain for 20 days, but it is easier to prove that he was unable to follow his ordinary pursuits due to the hurt. The opinion of the doctor attending on the patient is important, on the point of his disability. A mere stay of 20 days in the hospital does not make injury grievous, unless the injured person was in severe bodily pain, or unable to follow his ordinary pursuits for a period of 20 days. Ordinary pursuits include acts of daily routine of a person, such as eating food, taking bath, going to the toilet, etc. but do not refer to the duties that constitute the job of a person. An injury which endangers life may cause severe bodily pain for 20 days, but an injury which causes such pain may not be dangerous to life, but it is still a grievous hurt under this clause.</p>",

This analytical system utilises high temperatures to vapourise the metallic elements of the primer residues and to detect and quantitate them. Typically the residue is deposited on the back of the firing hand of the suspect who fired the gun: Detection of primer residue in the palm suggests defence gesture rather than firing of a gun. In suicide with handgun, primer residue on the palm may be due to cradling the gun with this hand at the time of firing</p>",

Blunt force on areas where the skin is close to bone, and the subcutaneous tissues are scanty, may produce a wound which by linear splitting of the tissues (as the skin is easily stretched during impact), may look like incised wound. The sites are the scalp, eyebrows, cheek bones, lower jaw, iliac crest, perineum, and shin. A wound produced by a fall on the knee or elbow with the limb flexed, and by a broken glass or sharp stone also simulates incised wound.</p><p>In abdomen thorax hand skin is not in close proximity with bones.</p>",
